"We stayed for two nights at the end of Feb 2022 and loved it. We stayed in a suite on the 5th or 6th floor which had floor to ceiling windows on the entirety of two sides of the room, affording incredible views over the lake and surrounding forests. Our bathroom had a jacuzzi bath from which you could look out over the scenery.The hotel is secluded and very peaceful and has been designed perfectly to blend in with the surroundings. There is little noise or light from other properties and you can't see any roads or hear any traffic. You are surrounded by nature and can see monkeys and birds within a few metres anywhere on the property.The staff are lovely and friendly and were happy to help with any of our requests. The breakfast was fantastic - a buffet serving a wide range of Eastern and western options, with a team also cooking fresh bacon, sausages and other options on the grill outside the breakfast hall in the courtyard. Dinner was also great, with options for a buffet or a la carte from 2 or 3 different restaurant areas.The hotel pool is clean and well-attended so you can order food/drinks poolside if wanted. At sunset you can lie by the pool and listen to a pipe player while watching the sun set over the trees.We used the hotel as a base to visit the nearby Sigirya rock, around a 45min drive away. We had a driver for our holiday but the hotel offer drivers if needed. There isn't too much else to do around the area so, after visiting Sigirya, we felt a two night stay was ample.",Positive
The environment this hotel is in makes the property special. No regrets about booking it. Food is also decent.,Positive
"It‚Äôs a unique setting where the architect has sympathetically designed the building to blend into the landscape. This attracts wildlife like monkeys.  comfortable rooms, great food and drink, bit pricey but the level of service is always excellent. This was our 3rd stay in 6 years.

We would stay here over and over again. Our room was incredible. It was huge with a jacuzzi bath and a lovely balcony looking out over the jungle. The dining facilities were brilliant, seeming endless options of consistently delicious food. Everything is set up for you to have an unforgettable stay, they even have a long list of excursions for guests. We visited  Dambulla, as well as Sigiriya and did a lovely jungle treck around the hotel with a hugely knowledgeable and interesting member of the hotel staff. We couldn't recommend the Kandalama more.",Positive

"During our family trip through Sri Lanka we also stayed in the Heritance Kandalama. The location in the middle of the jungle is fantastic. Surrounded only by green trees, a lake and all kind of animals (especially monkeys) is really special. Checkin was simple and fast. The infinity pool was a great way to cool down after the car ride to the hotel and gives great views towards the lake. The rooms and the hotel itself are getting little bit old, which you can see and feel with some of the amenities. However in general it is well maintained. The breakfast is great with many fresh juices, good cappuccino and fresh fruits. We enjoyed it.",Positive

"Scenery, location, contact with nature, architecture, scenic views, exceptional vibe.
The fact that the property is ‚Äúdated‚Äù as per other comments is what makes its charm. if you are looking for new, shiny, 5-star bling, go to Dubai. if you‚Äôre looking for heritage, this is the place!",Positive
"Absoulutely everything. I have been to the Kandalama in 2001 as a 14 years old girl and could never forget this place. 20 years later it was exactly like it was in my memories. I enjoyed every minute there and I wish I could stay there forever.
I can recommend this special place 10000%",Positive

This is one on the finest hotels that I have stayed at, the whole complex is so well interwoven in to the natural surrounding forest on one side and a lake facing the other. There are wonderful natural sounds of different birds and monkey cries. If you‚Äôre lucky, the monkeys might come up to your window, as they did to ours - keep those doors locked. In the evenings there was an amazing flute player near the pool and filled it with tranquility",Positive

Panorama. Dramatic view of the lake embedded in the nature. Funny and curious monkeys running around,Negative
"We loved our stay here and felt it was the most unique and special hotel stay we‚Äôve ever had. The views over the jungle that this place offers are unbeatable and the feeling of being completely immersed in nature, seeing monkeys playing in the trees and around the pool. The hotel is designed by a prominent international architect (Sri Lankan but globally recognised) and it is obvious in the design of the building from the big things to the details. It really is a one of a kind type of hotel. On top of that the food was excellent and the staff were incredible attentive and helpful, from the first arrival, to organising transport, to chefs and room service (who left us a cheeky monkey towel creation as a surprise!). We used the spa to have a couples massage and both thought it was the best massage we‚Äôd ever had, not just because of the dramatic views out of the spa rooms (it was experienced a wild thunderstorm at the time!) but the masseuses were exceptional. This place is a must and we felt it was very good value for money all things considered.",Positive
"This location is absolutely mind-blowing! Words cannot do the location justice. We lost count of how much wildlife we saw there - monkeys sleeping in the tree was a definite highlight! The room was really comfortable, well appointed, and had an amazing view. The infinity pools across the reservoir are incredible, we could've stayed there all day!",Positive

amazing hotel. stunning location and the staff were impeccable,Positive
"hotel needs renovation.
They try to control guests transportations,  they charge 3 times higher money fr the cars and dont allow outside cars to come to hotel so guests are forced to pay more.
At night there are some areas in the Corridor without light......lighting needs improvement. I am an architect and i jv designed many up class hotels.",Negative
"Wow, what an amazing hotel, Without a doubt the best we have ever stayed at! If you love wildlife, this is the place for you. It felt like we were staying inside a zoo, watching 100s monkeys everywhere and on your balcony, wild elephants walking around the lake and all the other weird and wonderful animals and insects. We were upgraded on arrival to a room with a jacuzzi bath, the views from the room, bathroom and all of the hotel were breathtaking. Food was outstanding, the buffet had absolutely everything you could wish for and the a la carte restaurant was always perfect. Lastly, thank you to the exceptional staff for you hospitality, you made our stay one we will never forget. If you are going to Sigiriya, please do not miss this hotel, you will regret it!",Positive
The architecture and interior design of the hotel is the best.,Positive

"Kandalama Heritance is a masterpiece of contemporary architecture by Geoffrey Bawa. I think that it totally worth a visit. It looks a little be old, even decadent, and the best days are in the past but , in my opinion , this makes it even more fascinating.",Positive
"This hotel was the best choice to start our honeymoon. The whole bulinding is an architectural miracle. I really enjoyed the open corridors. OUr room (with jacuzzi) was perfect, spacious and it had a really calm atmosphere. It was a pleasure to wake up for the monkeys and staring them from our balcony. The jacuzzi was also nice and comfortable to use. The hotel is a bit expensive but it is not a surprise. You will need a driver to get around the area beacuse it is far from everything. However I think that is why it is a real miracle. The pool is also good and nice and the foods (breakfast, dinner) were excellent :)",Positive
Jacuzzi and pool were nice. Monkeys and views were nice. Room service was good.,Positive

We booked this hotel for the architectural marvel that it is. But there was nobody to explain to us about it.  We were given Tom 315 which was very nice and overlooked the forest and the hills. The bathroom was fantastic as well. The hotel has 2 pools. Spa and 2 restaurants were not operational.,Positive

"The property is a beautifully built house with an exceptional location. Breathtaking nature around with trees, animals and nature sounds. Nice!",Positive

Great swimming pools. Beautiful views of jungle and lake. Comfortable bed and room. Very nice driver brought me on tour of Sigiriya.,Positive
elephants and jungle,Negative
I have stayed at Kandalama a few times before and this is an architectural gem that is an experience no matter the weather you visit. We had a beautiful sunny day followed by one with pouring tropical rain and the place is magical in both. So the overall experience we had was very enjoyable and positive!! All the staff is extremely warm and helpful.,Positive
"beautiful location, gorgeous views. super interesting architecture with lots of character. helpful and smiling staff.",Positive
Nothing outstanding like what I saw in the media. It is big and put in a scenic location.,Positive
The location and architecture are unbelievably good. The facilities were designed nice. But it requires a significant attention at the management level.,Positive
I liked the size of the room and that it was in the middle of the jungle so we saw monkeys from our room. staff were very polite and friendly.,Positive
Lovely setting.,Positive
Really tasty and variety food buffet and snaks. Delicious.,Positive
It's a fabulous location and an Architectural marvel .....everyone should experience this dance with nature that Geoffrey Bawa has executed so beautifully!!!,Positive
"The architecture, the nature around and the views are worth a visit (for a coffee)",Positive
"The Heritance is a fantastically designed building, blurring into the surrounding lake and trees. The wonderful pools overlook the lake and provide a great spot to cool off. The hotel is well situated to visit Dambulla caves and Sigiriya. The spa is also great and the spa staff were very friendly. Definitely worth a visit if you‚Äôre in the area and don‚Äôt mind the cost. The location and building are the real stars.",Positive
"We liked location, that hotel were in forest. The views were beautiful.",Positive
"stunning but a bit bated, food and staff where great. nothing to special for the price tho.",Positive
"The place is for sure amazing and the view is breathtaking.
The personal is d helpful. So nice also to see the monkeys everywhere especially at the pool.
Food is good too.
We received chocolates and fruits for our honeymoon. That was super nice !",Positive

The hotel was unique and set on a beautiful lake. There were a variety of wildlife around the hotel.,Positive
"A beautiful hotel in the jungle, we loved it.",Positive
The food price was bit high for me since I am from Bangladesh,Positive
"personnel is very stingy, and liars, wanted to charge extra for room upgrade, due to in availability for the pre booked room, but we were not even informed regarding the upgrade; they didn‚Äôt want to give free welcome drink the next morning as well (we arrived late night, and didn‚Äôt want to have welcome drink at night)",Negative
perhaps options of transportation within hotel as it‚Äôs too big place walk- nice to have a buggy,Negative
pools were dirty,Negative
"nothing, it was a real treat",Positive
The hotel needs a little bit of renewing but overall very beautiful,Positive
I am not sure why small babies are allowed because they have no entrainment for that and their screams ruin everything. Also adults at the pool screaming and racing ruining the whole point of that place in the jungle. The staff should promote more that everyone should be mindful with their noise in public places. Also the food by the pool was really bad and so expensive for the area.,Negative
Empty minibar in the room,Negative
"Bathroom can be bit dry, coz after having a shower it's allover wet & a separate shower would have been a extra plus point additional to the jacuzzi",Negative
Food can be made better.,Positive
Nothing!,Negative
"The guests from the rooms who came at 12 at night and talked loudly in the hallway until they woke us up. the room was close to the elevator and it was the place to say goodbye. The hotel could request respectful behavior from their customers. It is normal not to shout near the rooms where others sleep. We would have liked to stay longer but we realized that we would not have been able to rest and we went to a small hotel, where it was quiet (and cheaper)",Positive
"staff we lovely but check in was very confused and no information was given about activities, restaurant, etc",Negative
could be a little cleaner for a 5 star resort. needs a little maintenance,Negative
Nothing,Negative
It's too far from where I live to return any time soon,Positive
"Maybe offering a boat tour to see the entire view of the hotel would be nice!
Meal options are limited. if you go for a la carte, you get only western meal, so only options you have will be a buffet which was not my favorite style.,",Negative
Booked deluxe room which did not match expectation for price. Hotel staff were very kind and efficient and gave us a better room..thank you.,Negative
"You pay for location. Prices were high for any extras at an 'international rate' comparable to major cities. Some quality is below standard for this cost and five star rating.
Individually the staff are lovely and helpful but at times the system seemed overworked and maybe understaffed. We were here during a holiday poya weekend and it seemed too busy to be managed.",Positive
"It would be nice if the hotel added more European positions in the breakfast
I cannot eat curry for breakfast and spicy dishes.
By the way, the fruits were juicy and sweet.",Positive
Not well navigated air conditioner so we switched it off and during the night it was a little bit stuffy.,Negative
Nothing,Negative
"Maybe the quality of breakfast could be better, for example waffles and pastry, it was quite dry.",Negative
Self-service tea and coffee in the breakfast are not acceptable in this level hotel.,Negative
nothing,Negative
getting a little dated,Negative
"I was disappointed that there‚Äôs no elephants in the winter. the food was ok, but I did miss a fine dining experience.",Negative
"This is very minor, but signs to the hotel are under Aitken Spence Hotel. If your driver knows where they are going it‚Äôs fine, but if you are driving yourself or have a driver relying on signs it‚Äôs confusing.",Negative
"The nasty monkeys, but they belong to the jungle there.",Negative
inside the hotel and gym are doesn‚Äôt feel fresh air ‚Ä¶ they need to use some air freshener.,Negative
"The food (room service) was really good experience, we found fly in the soup, it was not very clean!",Negative
be careful with monkeys :),Negative
Not much everything was great,Positive
"the property is great , facilities / location / staff all up to the standards",Positive
a lot of insects,Negative
Laundry services bit overpriced. Same with Spa offer. We found it to be the same prices as in Europe or even bit more. The hotel is impressive in its size and location but looks a little dated and worn. Could use some renovation,Negative
Hard to answer...the room didn't have an iron..,Negative
There is nothing not to like. Just don‚Äôt forget that you are in the middle of a beautiful natural area. The last few kilometers of the road to the hotel are unpaved. There are warning signs not to feed the monkeys :-),Positive
all great,Positive
The only thing that could be improved was the restaurant near the reception. Quite high prices compared to your usual restaurants in Sri Lanka and the quality didn‚Äôt necessarily meet the price.,Positive
"it‚Äôs far from everything, so you have to have breakfast, lunch and dinner at the hotel. the cafe and √Ä la cart menus were okay, trying to do western dishes - we would have loved to order a Sri Lanka curry or roti dishes but weren‚Äôt on the menu which was a real shame. the buffet in the evening was a good selection, but pricey 6000 rupees (¬£15) not including drinks - feel especially pricey when all we would eat was the Sri Lanka curries and food, which at a local restaurant would cosy 900 rupees (2.25).
also transport to Sigiriya lions rock was expensive through the hotel but again, due to it being secluded you had to book through them.",Positive
"The rooms are old and were not so clean. The drinks were not good.Some amenities missing to make it a real 5-star hotel. Check-in is made really complicated. There are constructions going on and rooms are noisy. In wedding season (like in March), the hotel is very loud, lot of things going on. Huge windows to enjoy the views all over the hotel, but windows very dirty. here are just about 8 pool beds, that are often occupied by day spa visitors.",Negative
"I‚Äôd like to suggest adult only areas for pools and restaurant.  the Infinity pool setting is very adult yet we had to leave to go to the Dambulla wing pool because two adults saw fit to bring 5 screaming kids under 6 resulting in us and another adult leaving what should be a tranquil setting. Likewise our evening meal was disturbed when a family of 4 rude adults with 1 unruly toddler decided to sit next to us in a less than half empty restaurant. When you cannot trust your guests to be courteous, enforcing areas or times would make this better and appealing for all.   I‚Äôve mentioned in a previous review that better lighting in rooms for reading and ladies doing makeup and in the restaurant at the tables to read menus.",Negative
"the location is great (and the staff too) but it is really really old hotel. it has not been renovated for years and it definitely should be.
the good is at most averave",Positive
"buffet dining, would have liked smaller venues!!",Positive
Not a dislike but the room service menu could be improved to contain some local speacialities; having said that the restaurants have a very wide buffet dinner selection which is very varied and tasty,Negative
We stayed in the suite with jacuzzi. I understand the natural vibe the resort is trying to give out but the the rooms need refurbishment. Curtains were quite dirty along with the sofas.,Negative
The water in the bathroom was heavily chlorinated and not nice to wash/brush teeth with,Negative
Dinner at a la carte restaurant was not special,Negative
"other reviews mention it - the only thing that lets this place down, is that it‚Äôs a little tired - older sheets/towels/plumbing/general decor, and some areas of the hotel are particularly unloved
but you have to look past it for the other wonderful things that it brings",Positive
"nothing not to like but thing that could be improved
updating the decor and ambiance of the rooms
could have nicer and local toiletries products in the bathroom
for how outstanding many other aspects are, I think the food could be better. perhaps instead of of focusing on so much choice and volume
the pool could use more care for the water with lots of guests",Positive
I have seen one cockroach in our room,Negative
hotel little old,Negative
monkeys - you cannot use the balcony because you are harassed by them. aways remember to close the balcony door,Negative
"The distances you have to cover from the reception and restaurant were enormous. The hotel has 3 little pools, one was overcrowded and the other didn't look very clean.",Positive
"The views from the jacuzzi were amazing but since we were in the last room people could see from outside, not ideal.
It seems to be a popular hotel and even if it is not cheap it is always very crowded. At times there are no seats available at the swimming pool. There‚Äôs also children in the main pool.
Food for dinner was ok, not amazing",Positive
They were hurry up to collect the payment on arrival u s d $ rupees.?,Negative
"One night we tried the evening buffet for 6000LKR per person, which was just average. The Western Food like Pasta was ok, but nothing special. The best part was the local curries. But you can eat in other smaller restaurants in Sri Lanka better and cheaper. Besides a great experience, I have one critic point, which happened during checkout. They force you to pay by credit card or in cash by USD only. You cannot use local currency, which was disappointing, as I only needed to settle some drinks and other small expenses.",Positive
"property is little Dirty, I know there is jungle always monkeys move to room  and we can‚Äôt enjoy the property with spent money üòî actually it was like a old hotel but as I know build in 2018 but enjoy it highly recommend in the world",Positive
There is absolutely nothing I didn't like...,Positive
breakfast ends at 10 am,Negative
All was great,Positive
I had to contact the resort directly by phone to arrange airport pick-up. The website contact didn't work.,Positive
"Sitting capacity by the poolside appeared to be inadequate, the fine dining restaurant though busy seemed to lack any ambiance and most importantly, we were left to discover for ourselves the sunrise and sunsets location and times- they were simply amazing",Negative
buffet too expensive for the quality. The tip is to take in room service menu on the beautiful terrace.,Negative
Food and service in the restaurants can be a lot better! We tried the fine dining restaurant at the 7th floor and we were very disappointed with the service and the quality of food :(,Negative
"The rooms are average. I've stayed in 3-4 star hotels where the rooms feel nicer interior and comfort wise. The rooms are not bad, but not 5 star feel. Worth also noting location is very remote, so not the most convenient to casually pop out and explore locally. A driver will be required.",Positive
Monkeys get a bit close! not so much local cuisine..,Negative
Club sandwiches at pool side poor. Fridge very stained. And nothing in it. Had to keep door to balcony shut due to hordes of monkeys.,Negative
We had no balcony in this room.,Negative
I ordered a pot of tea from room service and they get me the same tea bags that I had in my room. It was really strange and unexpected from this kind of hotel.,Negative
nothing. It was paradise,Positive
Overly complex arrival arrangements - could have been handled by lovely reception staff rather than somewhat officious accountant in separate office. Also no towels in room on arrival.,Positive
Indian Vegetarian foods.,Negative
Perfect. Impresdive arquitecture,Positive
Nothing.,Negative
"The hotel did feel a little like it had fallen from its grace when it was first built. Alot of the rooms, including the incredible lounge, felt quite empty. In addition, the bar closed quite early with little warning. Be warned as well, the hotel is very out the way, so you are reliant on the hotel for all amenities.",Positive
some extremely rude and noisy guests !,Negative
"Only one of the restaurants has a terrace. Restaurants are decorated worse than the rest of the hotel. If the food and atmosphere in the restaurants were better, we could definitely stay here for a week. This does not apply to breakfast - breakfasts are good here.",Positive
food took too long during lunch and dinner.,Negative
nothing not to like,Negative
no hand shower is,Negative
Everything was perfect,Positive
Food could have been better.,Positive
I liked everything,Positive
nothing it was perfect,Positive
"Food was ok but nothing special, for this price (especially for the restaurant) I would expect betterSome equipment is old and problematic, our jacuzzi broke twice.It could be a little bit cleaner. It is far from dirty, but the hotel is old, and some parts don't look really clean.",Positive
all was good,Positive
"Outdated furniture, noisy minibar, natural pool, no much things to do in the evening..",Negative
Nothing,Negative
5 star hotels should have ironing boards and all necessary toiletries in the room but we needed to request them.,Negative
booked two singles and were given a double- this might bother some people but wasn‚Äôt an issue for us,Negative
"Just beware it‚Äôs a bit of a drive back to civilisation. Only a consideration for your timings, though.
The lunch buffet is perhaps a little expensive, given it‚Äôs the same cost as dinner.",Negative
"We found the room a little noisy with the fridge running at night, but otherwise everything was perfect.",Positive
for a hotel this size there are only a handful of sunloungers arranged around two very small swimming pools.  this leads to a great deal of stress between guests who just want to relax.  it would seem fairly straightforward to enlarge the decking area to allow for the correct ratio of loungers to guests and I do feel that this is something they need to address as a priority.,Positive
Can't really fault this place. Although don't expect to be able to go off exploring outside the hotel grounds on foot. It's a place to go to enjoy the hotel itself and relax!,Positive
could do with some renovations,Negative
"To be honest, the room was amazing overlooking the lake and the jungle but it was a bit outdated - there isn‚Äôt enough sockets and the light was minimal at night and the bathroom was a bit grimy, lots of limescale and ants everywhere. I understand it‚Äôs in the jungle but it could have been kept a bit better. But we were still happy with our stay, just this was a bit of a surprise bearing in mind the level of the hotel.",Positive
"The air con in the rooms was difficult to work - there was no controller to set different temperatures, just and on and off switch which didn‚Äôt seem to work at times. We dis however also have a room fan which helped keep us cool.",Negative
nothing,Negative
"Maybe they could have been more pool chairs, even though we were able to have some.",Positive
"the food is not 5 star, and definitely overpriced. you might prefer to go to the ‚Äûa la carte‚Äú restaurant.",Negative
"a lot of staff. Upon arrival, for some reason, they took me to a cafe on the same floor to sign a guest card, why not do it immediately at the reception? then we went to the reception again and then again to the cafe to drink a welcome drink. in the restaurant for breakfast, too, a lot of service go constantly, looking for work for themselves",Positive
All perfect,Positive
There is nothing not to like,Negative
"1. No entertainment at night although the facilities are available.
2. Jacuzzi is difficult for elderly persons to use. Hence, a separate shower is needed.
3. Meals provided to drivers are below acceptable standard. They deserve better meals even if at an extra charge.",Positive
"drinks were expensive for Sri Lanka. $12 for g&t.
The A La carte restaurant was completely empty and everyone at the hotel was at the buffet.
Buffet options were extremely limiting.
lunch options were not authentic and even frozen pizza. Not the type of food expected from a 5 star hotel.",Negative
"I was robbed in hottel.  I left my gold ring and chain with jewels at the hotel after check-out when I was driving in taxi I realizing I left the jewelry in the bathroom. When I came back 20 minutes later the room had already been cleaned and I couldn't find the jewelry, the staff refused to help and suggested that I contact the police instead of checking with the staff.",Negative
"I know it‚Äôs a first world problem but not enough space by infinity pool located by lake although there were two others less attractive
On arrival no real explanation of amenities  ie pools ,eating arrangements /Wi-Fi
Limited information in room
Was supposed to be stocked mini bar but wasn‚Äôt
Could  do with decent coffee
m/c in room .",Positive
It‚Äôs pretty remote and so you are limited to eating at the hotel (which can become pretty repetitive if you‚Äôre eating the buffet) but the remoteness is also a benefit and there is plenty to do nearby.,Positive
"Food options at the cafe/room service could be better. More vegetarian options, less western",Negative
"Quite far from town and food is a little overpriced, so best to consider this before choosing B&B only",Negative
nothing,Negative
Little bit over priced. Room was kinda old. Food could be better with that price. Employees were really busy. Lot of people.,Negative
"The premises are quite old and most of the furnishings are dated and worn. The place needs a facelift! If they do so, this place could charge much more for a night. At the current condition the rates are adequate, as you pay for the amazing concept and nature arround.Oh, and make sure you properly close AND LOCK the balcony doors, otherwise monkeys get inside and mess up the room (happened to us- the door was closed, but seems that not locked properly).",Negative
Little delay in service,Negative
staff was not exactly polite,Negative
night shift staff at the launch,Negative
the lunch and dinner menus was more similar with minor variations.,Negative
"staff could benefit from additional hospitality training, not as refined as you would expect in a upscale place like this",Negative
"some staff at the restaurant was rude. Also, they didn't pay attention to the fact that the breakfast was part of the room booking and charged me twice. It was a hassle to get a refund.",Negative
Nothing ... all went great.,Positive
The trim rates are over priced for the facilities offered,Negative
The price was too steep for the slow service and the quality of good.,Negative
"The free breakfast was included in my booking. Never the less I was charged for breakfast at the checkout. This fact is really disappointing.
As soon as we arrived at Christmas time, the hotel was full of cheap and tasteless led lights and awfully handmade Christmas trees. never want to see that again. Lack of respect to beautiful building.",Negative
Dirty towels a dirty table clothes in restaurant,Negative
Sadl the buffet was a little disappointing.,Negative
except for one staff at reception all other staff were very helpful and friendly .,Positive
"There are a few issues with this hotel. First of all, foreigners are charged different prices, which frankly, made us feel overcharged throughout our whole stay. The prices for the accommodation, food and transportation organized by the hotel were therefore very high compared to Sri Lankan standards.
The main problem we had at this hotel, however, was that we did not feel the service was very forthcoming. Few of the staff actually speaks English. The ones that do did not treat us very warmly or were attentive at all. When we arrived at the hotel, no one even greeted us, we were just rushed to sign documents and then shown to our room without any explanations about the hotel.
Each night there was also a lot of noise going on. The last night we stayed, there was a huge party right above our room. We called reception 4 times about it and only at 2am someone finally picked up the phone. When we talked to the reception about it the next day, they did not even pretend to be sorry about the situation. The hotel was also very sparely occupied so we or the party people could have easily been given another room‚Ä¶
Overall we felt treated differently because we were foreigners. The staff seems to prefer locals and is definitely not operating on a 5 star level.",Positive
Room seemed to be little old now.,Negative
"We made the reservation through Booking.com. I made the booking for my brother & his wife.
Booking.com show invalid card. But my credit card everything ok. I called the hotel before the booking day. They didn‚Äôt back to me. Again called the hotel same day morning. They didn‚Äôt back to me again. My brother & his wife went to the hotel they said needs to pay & my card can‚Äôt accepted.
* That‚Äôs ok. Main issue is the they didn‚Äôt back to me with the information even I called 2-3 times to the hotel. Finally they wasted my brother & his wife‚Äôs time. I gifted this booking for my brother & his wife. Finally they made the payment.
This time I am very disappointed with Booking.com also.",Positive
"it so mush more for a foreign passport holder even though I am a srilankan by birth
library could be more organised",Negative
"Do not leave your personal belongings unattended.
Bring your own power as some of the outlets are not working.
the room service is very slow.",Positive
"After our dinner we wanted to sleep after a long day, we got called to the room if we could come to the reception to sign something. We thought this wasn‚Äôt really politely and could have waited till the morning. The airco made a lot of noice, even after we shut it down.
further everything was good.",Positive
"A little more information about the hotel, meal times, bar and cafe opening times would have been helpful.",Positive
Probably ready for a room and decor update to just bring some polish to a 5 star venue.,Positive
Furniture need upgrade for more comfort.,Negative
"The hotel relies heavily on tour groups and that spoils the atmosphere for individual travelers who have paid a high tariff to stay at the hotel. On the first day, the dining room was packed with tables and hoeups, it felt like being at a very crowded wedding banquet. Onky buffet was available, and mass cooked meals always suffer in quality.",Positive
"Old air-conditioner that didn‚Äôt change the temperature as we needed, washed out linen and we had to request the robes ( they were washed out as well )and loafers. Bar fridge was empty and the food we ordered were bit bland.",Negative
Restaurant buffet was poor,Negative
"Hotel really need to be renovated. It‚Äôs not that you expect for this money, this location and exterior design. Old and scratched shower, very modest but in the bad way furniture, a lot of bluebottles in the restaurant.
Very thin blanket,  not heater, it was really cold at night because the hotel located close to forest.
Staff is good only in the restaurant.
When I just enter staff was asked me to pay for the room, it wasn‚Äôt a 5 star hotel style.
Swimming pool and sun beds also looks not as on the pictures, need to be renovated too.
Disappointed. Will not chose it for next time.",Negative
When we arrived the premises  we confused with  their documents.That hotel reception officer is strictly asked my wife's National identity. And charged extra payment for my child .In the first half of hour we were disappointed..They need to replace all the washroom items.some bulbs in the room are not working,Negative
"room wasn‚Äôt clean enough,bathtub wasn‚Äôt clean enough",Negative
I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO CONTACT THE HOTEL TO ASK FOR AN INVOICE FOR A MONTH NOBODY GOT BACK TO ME,Negative
pool lifeguard person,Negative
the food was not good at all,Negative
service was terrible. asked for a twin room and va e me a double room with extra bed assuming it would work. they forgot to clean it next day and when they came late at night they left us without towels. then called them 3 times to bring them and still had to wait 1h.,Negative
"the hotel is stunning architecturally. However without a doubt, this is one of the most un-cozy hotels I‚Äôve ever been to. The seating areas inside remind me of cafeterias, and are plain uncomfortable. the pool area looks way better on the pictures than it actually is. for dinner you cannot sit outside. Such a big H√¥tel with so much wasted potential. why not install a cozy bar outside ? You can tell that the rooms were high standard way back however they would need a refurbishment YESTERDAY. I am honestly disappointed.",Negative
It is a little expensive considering the quality of the facilities etc. A little tired. However you are paying for the location.,Negative
"food is not great, should be refined. too expensive for the quality.",Negative
"The hotel has a feeling of a once- great hotel that is being poorly run and severely underfunded.
We were initially shown to our room which was very noisy with building work. When I rang to complain, we were then shown to another room. However the fact that I was given the first room (the noise was unbearable) left a very bad taste in our mouths.
In our new room our fridge was filthy and just lacked basic amenities (such as water). There were no staff around the hotel, and everything felt in a state of disrepair.
Of the 3 pools, only 1 was in a useable condition, which had only 15 sun beds for the whole hotel.
I actually felt for the staff who were trying their best to keep this hotel afloat.
So disappointed with our experience at a hotel we were very much looking forward to visiting.",Negative
"NEVER EVER HAVE I EXPERIENCED SUCH AN UNFRIENDLY FRONTOFFICE MANAGER. IF YOU ARE IN THE SERVICE TRADE, YOU SHOULD BE SERVICES MINDED. THIS MAN WAS SO UNFRIENDLY. A REASON NEVER TO BOOK YOUR PROPERTY AGAIN.",Negative
"1- You have to take off-road for about ten minutes to reach the hotel.
2- The internet is super slow where you can barely use WhatsApp or any other instant messages apps. It is super slow to the limit you can not use google sometimes.
3-The insects and bats are everywhere. To go to the restaurant you have to pass by three bats flying at the entrance of the restaurant. In addition, there was a lizard inside the restaurant next to our table. It was an unpleasant experience at all having dinner at the restaurant.
4- The staff of the restaurant was unprofessional and unfriendly at all. One of them gave us the bill to pay for it and once I told him my booking was half-board he replies rudely you have to pay for the drinks. He could simply be polite and reply "" sorry sir, but half-board booking does not include beverages"". In addition, I asked him for napkins and he gave them to me as like he wants to hit me.
5-The next day, I ordered breakfast to have in my room. I had to wait 45 minutes for the room services to bring it. Unfortunately, when I told the guy I waited for you for 45 minutes he replied "" 45 minutes!!!"" and then looked at his phone as he didn't believe me and then replied impolitely "" oh yes 45 minutes sorry"". Is this an appropriate method to treat the residents?
5-Due to the bad experience at the restaurant, the next day I wanted to have dinner in my room. However, this was an unpleasant experience again. After waiting so long for the dinner, the guy came and to be honest he was polite, but he brought a bill with him and I told him my booking is half-board so the dinner should be included. I called the room services and they told me rudely that half-board booking is only at the restaurant so if you want to have your dinner in the room you have to pay for it! so I asked them to call the manager and he replied I will call him and back to you.",Negative
"it didn‚Äôt feel like a 5 star hotel and lacked facilities. The hotel is isolated so you really have to eat onsite and dining options are limited to a cafeteria- like buffet or a dreary √† la carte restaurant with a very limited and dated menu. Bizarrely, there is no terrace to have dinner outside. Pool area is small with very few sunloungers - I counted 15 loungers for over 100 rooms .",Negative
"For shared facilities, it felt very much like a resort, lacked atmosphere and the food options were not great. (Not enough local food).",Negative
"The room was dark and the equipment are getting old.
The main issue is the noise isolation, you ear 100% of what is happening in the rooms next to you‚Ä¶especially toilet flush, bath evacuation, conversations, tv program of your neighbour‚Ä¶etc
The toilet evacuation are passing in the room!!!And when your neighbours are waking up at 5:00 AM 2 consecutive nights is just exhausting.
For us it was not worth the price.",Negative
"this hotel needs a renovation
rooms have some major bugs -
especially the bathrooms need a makeover
connecting rooms were not prepared upon arrival
I feel prices are steep",Negative
"A bit far from Sigiriya, and the road to the hotel is a dirt road.",Negative
"It is a bit dated. May have seen it‚Äôs best days. The buffet is a bit tiring at dinner, need to fresh this up a bit. As a 5 star maybe having one or two more themed restaurants to give variety. The bar is in a weird open space area with no character. Can be a bit dark and just needs a modernization.",Negative
"tired, difficult to negotiate",Negative
Unfortunately the quality of food has gone down since my last stay here. This was really disappointing as Kandalama was always known for its breakfast and dining experience and the food! The main disappointment was the breakfast on the day we were leaving when the hotel was at full occupancy and we were redirected to the top floor conference hall for breakfast.. it unfortunately wasn‚Äôt well thought out and it felt like being in a marriage hall!,Negative
"we were told the hotel was full and hence we‚Äôd have a room with no lake views. however, hotel was practically empty with very few guests so we felt downgraded for no reason.
buffet could have been better - lots of variety but some dishes lacked a bit of taste.",Negative
Dinner buffet was sub standard. Breakfast was ok. Not a memorable stay. Everything is old style. Only one power outlet to connect the phone charger and had to leave the phone on the floor.  Hotel needs to be upgraded at least to meet the must needs. There is a whirlpool in the room but can‚Äôt plug the drain hole.,Negative
