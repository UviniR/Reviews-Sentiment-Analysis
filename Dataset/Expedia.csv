Review,Sentiment
One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in,Positive
Rooms have luxury feel. Appreciate clean fluffy towels and floor towels. Could do with rug next to bed.,Positive
Very inconvenient electrical switches thru' headboard slats. No convenient square-pin plugs to charge mobile phones & laptops. ,Negative
This is a lovely place to base while visiting the ancient cities.  The staff are so friendly with very personal service - the buffet breakfast and dinners were amazing and the view over the lake was stunning.  It is very isolated and not near to any shops or other restaurants but it has everything you need for a great stay. ,Positive
"The hotel is very old and is definitely in need of renovation. Despite all the previous reviews about the lack of sunbeds at the pools, the hotel seems to ignore the feedback. 20 sunbeds for over 100 rooms simply is not enough.

The refrigerator in our room was moldy and dirty. Same for the toilet. How simple can it be to replace a twenty year old yellowish toilet seat?

The food is okay, but far from what you would expect at a 5* hotel. The yoghurts and cheeses are left uniced, so once you will have them at the buffet - they are warm and melting. It doesn't much to improve these kind of things. 

The management is aware of all the feedback, but doesn't do anything to improve. ",Negative
Beautiful hotel. Highly recommended ,Positive
"This is my second and sadly to state the last time to stay at this hotel as while trying to checkout I was bum rushed , as I was trying to be thrown out and unwelcome by a staff member called Sanjeewa as I didn’t go with the taxi that he referred to me which was way too expensive if a regular cab would take a 130 Rupees the one he referred to wants like 70 dollars. 
So when I asked for a late checkout he was really aggressive and unwelcoming the idea. And I’ve checked online if there are rooms that are available and there were more than 18 rooms that are available so I showed him but he didn’t care !


How sad that a hotel like this hire such people. 


",Negative
"Wanted to state how I got an extremely unprofessional way from” Sanjeewa” at the reception as I wanted a 2-3 hours late checkout but he was an unwelcoming and very offensive. 

How sad that a hotel like this hire such people. 

I guess all this is that because I didn’t use the taxi that he referred to which is X 200 times more expensive than the normal ones. 

And the star that I put is for the look from inside the room that many will like. ",Negative
Amazing hotel in a great remote location and wildlife around.,Positive
It is a beautiful place to stay. We enjoyed every minute of our stay ,Positive
Beyond amazing view and stellar service we had an excellent and restful two nights. The only thing that didn’t work was our room phone! Good thing there’s one in the bathroom too:) get a room on the upper floors the view is worth it. ,Positive
Needs alot of improvement in all sectors ,Negative
Disappointing food ,Negative
"This hotel has had its day.  It looks tired and dated. In our room the spa, toilet and safe didn't work. The buffett is ordinary. I would not stay here again.  ",Negative
"Unique architecture in a wonderful green area. Food, service and accomodation outstanding",Positive
It’s built into the caves! It has a beautiful view of Sigiriya. Lovely stay.,Positive
We got a room of sigiriya wing. The view would be better at dambula wing. There was a musty odor in the room.,Negative
"This place is meant to be an architectural wonder - and if you like miles of black marble, reinforced concrete and metal pillars it is. But it’s not my bag. However the setting is lovely, the staff are wonderful attentive kind and fun - and the food is AMAZING.",Positive
"It was an amazing being that close to nature. The kind staff and fascinating view made it easier to relax. The design is incredible, how they managed to build the hotel around the rocks. This was definitely worth it",Positive
"For a five star property the service was not good. The first day we were there electricity kept going off and on, like 5xwhile we were eating and when we were back in our room. We had an extra guest in one room,our driver. and we were told we just had to pay for breakfast buffet but they ended up charging me $100usd a night , for two nights. The next morning for breakfast my husband was in dress shirts and a vest as we were heading out to Sigirya and he was told to change his top whereas there were many people in swim wear. There was a lady in a bikini and eating and was not told to change. Poor service will not recommend",Negative
"Beautiful surroundings. The hotel is slowly being taken over by the jungle and it could use a bit of a refresh. The rooms are quite spacious, with amazing views over the jungle (had the jacuzzi room). Beware of the monkeys- they come over to the balcony and try to get in the room and steal food.",Positive
"Food, facilities & staff are excellent. Nature lovers, make it a point to visit this hotel. There is a vast history behind this place and surroundings. Travelers should read through this history b4 embarking the journey towards Kandalama. 
Overall a memorable experience.",Positive
"Room, foods, pools, spa, nature around the hotel are amazing.
Only negative thing is you have very limited activity option and hotel is very silent, especially for evenings",Positive
"Location is amazing and the hotel is 1 on long. Staff is very friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet as well as evening buffet are to die for. A huge selection of Sri Lanken as well as European food. Unfortunately our room wasn’t very clean and the bathroom is very run down, stainless steel and windows look very old and not polished which gives you almost the feeling it wasn’t cleaned. However after speaking to the manager we were upgrade to a better room however the bathroom issue still continued. All over I would def be back at Heritance Kandalama",Positive
"I really wanted to like this hotel. Friends who have been all say I'd love it. Unfortunately, I didn't have that experience. 

The architecture of the building is amazing, blending very subtly into its natural environment, with rock face forming parts of the building's walls,  and creepers covering the external wall further camouflaging the building into natural surrounding. It is teeming with birds, squirrels and other animals, plus the view to the lake is really beautiful.

But, when you look closer, upkeep and maintenance of the place seems lacking. From very stiff sliding doors of the cupboards in the rooms, to accumulation of bird droppings in some corners, to patchy lawns and poorly paved pathways, to dark corridors that make parts of the sprawling property seem a little eerie. 

Our mattress had seen better days and was too soft, and the hotel was not able to offer alternatives. 

Service staff try but could be better trained to be more customer and service oriented. ",Negative
"Everything was perfect, location, food, staff, but the room has to be renovated, it needs to be more refurbished",Positive
"The view from the infinity pool was magnificent- could see across the valley, horses grazing - and the back drop of the hills.
Buffet dinner was the best we had in Sri Lanka. Rooms were spacious and we had interconnecting room with our teenage children",Positive
Everything about this place was special.  the check in process was a bit slow,Positive
"This was an amazing place to stay, and we're so happy we picked it! The views from the rooms & swimming pools are incredible. The bathroom was nice and clean, and the jacuzzi bath overlooking the lake was spectacular! The team also organised a birthday cake for us, which was a really nice touch. Highly recommended!",Positive
Facilities are a bit old.,Negative
"One of a kind hotel in the nature. Supper breakfast and good food in the restaurant.
Best value for money ",Positive
"Location and view make it very special. The buffet dinners feel very cafeteria-like, not consistent with the architectural quality of the property. The staff are the most hospitable and helpful I have encountered.",Positive
"Never have I encountered such apathetic, unhelpful staff. This is not a 5 star hotel by any means and was the worst hotel I stayed at during my 8 days in Sri Lanka. This hotel has so much potential and beautiful architecture, but the service is atrocious.",Negative
"Ideal location to use as a base to explore the area. Wonderful staff, who were very attentive. We would highly recommend Heritance Kandalama.",Positive
"Nice hotel, amazing scenery. However need more control measures in place to ensure creatures cannot enter the bedrooms. ",Positive
"Upgraded to the royal suite was an unexpected surprise. 
The hotel is amazing. Staff are friendly and very helpful. 
Would highly recommend paying half board when booking. ",Positive
"I wanted to love this hotel but just couldn't. The architecture and the whole concept of this hotel is amazing however it is so outdated internally that the whole place needs a huge refurb. The rooms are extremely run down and all the tapware was badly corroded. Although tidy it still just seemed very dirty and not comfortable in any way. Also the public pool areas are tiny for the size of the hotel and there are never any sunbeds available and it always seemed crowded. There are so many more beautiful accomodation options in Sri Lanka that hardly get any recognition and are 100 times better and more eco friendly than this place. 

On a positive note the staff are very friendly and helpful and the food was great!  

",Negative
"bad service! room's where kinda old looking, they charged us for a lake view but the room was dirty and they had only one not lake room view to move us too..
also the staff wasn't the nicest, and they charged us for an extra person in the room although booking through orbitz that was the only way to book. over all theirs lots of bugs, room not that clean, and staff not nice.",Negative
"It was our first visit to this hotel and this part of Sri Lanka, we were very impressed with the reception and the building itself. The rooms ore not large but met our requirements. The eco friendly environment and selection of local and international food was wonderful. The gym facility requires a little updating but was adequate. The view from several locations from the hotel was breathtaking. From our location we were able to visit 3 of the UNESCO world heritage sites within 30 min to a 2 hour drive. Since the hotel is a little isolated they also provided Free accommodation and meals for our driver. ",Positive
Excellent view and service. Certainly worth of the money you paid. Family and children friendly.,Positive
A true classic with design provenance and a serene outlook. This Bawa Hotel is a must stay once for all architectural enthusiasts. It provides great access to the triangle of world heritage sites. ,Positive
Wonderful hotel nestled in the jungle. The buffet is fantastic with options for traditional Sri Lankan and intenational cuisine.,Positive
"The front desk staff was quite unfriendly and we were placed in a room excessively far from the reception. It was so far, that the staff has not even walked us to the room to show it to us. The room was run down and smelled musty, so we called for some freshening up. The bathroom wall had mold on it, the room furniture looked beaten up, the couch had a white stain, linens were not white...overall the place had a dirty look and feel, especially for a hotel, that claims to be luxury. 
The dinner buffet had a huge variety; however was overran by people, which made dining a but chaotic. No nice wine available on menu. 
We could not wait to leave this hotel; luckily only booked it for one night.",Negative
"This is the most confusing review I've ever had to write.
The building itself is absolutely incredible. I'm an architecture fan and would happily pay just to go see the building. It's magnificent.
In addition we got upgraded to a suite which was lovely.
",Positive
Special experience with nice atmosphere and good food,Positive
"However, the hotel has a strange feel as it's predominantly used by tour parties visiting Sigiriya and Dambulla cave temples and as a result just feels like a  transit hotel.",Negative
The pool areas are nice  but don't feel particularly comfortable and in an evening there isn't anywhere to sit for a drink that doesn't just feel like a hotel lobby.,Negative
The buffet restaurant was fine (food is actually very good) but again felt unwelcoming like a canteen and not somewhere you'd linger over a romantic meal.,Negative
"There are also some things that need attention. Obviously some of windows have been recently repainted in the restaurant, but the masking tape is all over the floor outside the windows. Wouldn't expect that in a 5 star. Plus the rooms do feel a little tired and need freshening up (and if you can work out the light/socket switch combination then I assume you get automatic membership to Mensa!)",Negative
"Plus, for an 'eco' hotel I'm surprised by the amount of plastic water bottles they use. Maybe get some flasks in the rooms that are refilled every day and can request extras?",Negative
"Overall, go if you can get a deal to see the building, but don't stay any longer than a couple of nights.",Negative
I just don't see it being somewhere anyone would return,Negative
Hotel was an oasis.  Architecture combined the surrounding jungle with the hotel itself.  Staff was lovely and helpful. Food excellent. I had two massages at the Hotel spa.  This too I would recommend ,Positive
"We really enjoyed our stay at the Kandalama Hotel. Our room was spacious with views from both windows. Monkeys climbed the vines outside our room & even sat on the balcony. We made use of the very nice swimming pools which are a good size. The food was excellent, such a range of dishes & food cooked to order -the best buffet we had on our trip to Sri Lanka. All the staff were friendly polite & helpful particularly the restaurant staff & housekeeping exceptional !
We found the location of the hotel ideal for visiting many of the sites in the cultural triangle without it feeling touristy. A beautiful setting in fact.",Positive
"The Heritance Kandalama is a stunning hotel, designed to maximise the views from its site but to blend into the landscape.  It's a little remote, but a luxurious base from which to explore Sigiriya,  the cave temples at Dambulla, and to see the elephant ""gathering"" on the lakeside in the National Park, if you're lucky, as we were.  We would almost have missed all that to simply spend time in hotel's beautiful open spaces and pools. If you're interested in tropical modernist architecture, this hotel is a must.",Positive
"Although I arrived 7:30pm, the hotel seems not ready so I still have to wait 10 min before I finally find some one I reception, and they seems not care for individual  travelers as most of their guests come in larger group. The worst thing is the restaurant which require formall wear to dine but the prawn I ordered taste poorly and the pork I ordered taste too bad to eat. The wine is ok though.",Negative
"Totally fabulous- especially food, bats, view and flute player by pool at sunset",Positive
A marvelous architecture by Geoffrey Bawa. Beautifully blended with nature. Just can't get enough of it!,Positive
"location and quality of service was great, friendly staff",Positive
It's been such a pleasure to stay here. The staff are very pleasant and generally the overall hospitality has Been great. The views from the hotel and architecture need not be specially mentioned. We all know the history and background of the hotel. ,Positive
Hotel is at best an old 3 star which is in need of renovation. The black marble effect in the room was worn and although it wasn't dirty it gave the appearance that it was. I booked with Expedia in July yet when I arrived the hotel was virtually empty with room available at a fraction of what I paid. The bar was pricey and hence deserted and given the remote isolation there was nothing to do after dinner. A very disappointing stay.,Negative
Design and amenities really great ! But not enough time to appreciate all that was available.,Positive
"First thing first, you have to be ok with all kinds of species inside the hotel, yes inside the room corridorsa and even inside your room. Bats, geckos, insects, monkeys... We even had one gecko inside the room and had to call reception to take it out.
The atmosphere of the hotel is too dim, tiling is black, a nightmare.
Some staff are friendly and well trained but most of them especially in the restaurant are not english speakers.
Rooms are not clean, also tiles are black which is not good indicator of hygiene.",Negative
"if you want poor service , broken furniture , to over pay , and dirty rooms
then this is the hotel for you.
Make sure you take medication for food poisoning if you eat the buffet , it looks great but it will give you problems",Negative
"Fabulous hotel, amazing views and fantastic staff.",Positive
"We enjoyed a relaxing three night stay here, helpful staff, beautiful views and great dining, highly recommend.",Positive
"I LOVE THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE HOTEL AND THE LOCATION. FOOD WAS NICE AS I HEARD BEFORE FROM MY FRIENDS. BED WAS COMFORTABLE ENOUGH SO AS THE PILLOWS. HOWEVER NOT HAPPY WITH THE BATHROOM AS THERE IS WATER LEAK IN THE BATH TUB. AND ALSO THE ITEMS SUPPLIED IN THE BATHROOM , SUCH AS SHOWER CAP, SOAP AND SO ON WERE USED IN OLD BOXES WHICH HAS BEEN REUSED SEVERAL TIME. THE ACCOMMODATION COST IS VERY HIGH COMPARED TO THE OTHER HOTELS. THUS SUCH REUSED BOXES SHOULDN'T BE USED AS IT WOULD NOT APPEALING ITEM SPECIALLY FOR THE FOREIGNERS AS WE DON'T GET TO EXPERIENCE THAT IN OTHER COUNTRIES AS THEY REPLACE NEW ITEMS EVERY DAY.   ",Positive
Hotel is beautiful. Service staff were friendly. Service was good for first night but lacking on the second night. Service can be more prompt. We had to ask 4 times for ice for our drinks before it was served.,Positive
Unique accomodation. Worth a visit if your in the area,Positive
"It is obvious that this hotel is a very nice hotel.  Unfortunately it has been let go too long without proper maintenance.  It could be a truely magnificent hotel but this is the only thing that lets it down.

Some things are:
A dodgy afterthought hot water system 
Cracks and scratches in the bath

Overall it is a very nice hotel and I would return.  The setting and the hotel mostly feels like a large stately oriental hotel of yesteryear.  

",Positive
"In the middle of the rainforest this hotel is a wonderful treat. The architecture, making use of.natural boulders and  vines, is impressive, the service is first rate and the room, with its view far out to the famous rock outcropping of Sigiriya is magnificent.  I was their to see a family of monkeys outside ny terrace in the morning and later swinging through the trees. 

This is an extensive property, with beautiful pools, good restaurants  and magnificent views everywhere, and it provides a wonderful and peaceful break from travel in a hot and humid climate.",Positive
The hotel itself is an art. Brace yourself in calmness and mindfulness. That's how you should use this unforgettable place. Wonderful fusion of human art  work and Mother Nature.,Positive
"Awesome views, excellent service.",Positive
"Incredible hotel, definitely unique. Stay there at least one night to experience - a little remote to make it a base for Cultural Triangle, but unmissable.",Positive
"Lovely location, excellent staff, great food.  My bathroom did have some ants however and the ceiling above the tub area leaked water. I assume it was when someone else was showering. Overall, nice hotel experience.",Positive
Unique property design and beautiful view.  The staff sometimes has difficulty understanding English.,Positive
"The staff were excellent; the food lovely. 
The hotel was very special, and we would thoroughly recommend it.",Positive
"It  was a wonderful stay. Cannot fault it at all.
highly recommend to stay at this place.",Positive
Wildlife,Positive
We have been visiting since its opening. Never been disappointed. Excellent service and great food. ,Positive
"Love the nature. Feel like live in a raim forest. Best food, service. Wanna go back again",Positive
"Bawa's masterpiece. Amazing architecture and space design. But don't expect too much. I had really terrible time especially first day, some staffs discriminate guests and you never get good service, although you pay a lot. You have to try the hotel once but I will not go back again.",Negative
An inspiring example of eco-design.This beautiful contemorary hotel was a delight.Magnificent site comlimented by good food and service. Try to get thereif you can!,Positive
"Perfect location,
Bawas masterpiece,
friendly staff,
good food.
We will come back next time.

",Positive
"This hotel is well located in the middle of the cultural triangle, even if it takes some time to reach it from the main road as it is in the middle of nature.",Positive
"Very good service and breathtaking location, we got an offer and the ratio quality/price was excellent. Better to arrange transport through external agencies, from the hotel is expensive. ",Positive
"1km long from beginning to end, 7 floors, 3 pools and food made for the gods, this hotel exudes pure taste and must be on every one's bucket list. Designed by the famous Geofrey Bawa and built in to a rock face, it is an architectural wonder. The views from the front pool are breathtaking. Please,please do your self a favour and visit.",Positive
"We had our son's wedding at heritance new hall and the service and the views were beyond our expectation. The Aussie bride and large Australian contingent were really happy and many told that it was the best wedding they ever attended. The staff has been great and they never said ""no"" to any of our reasonable requests.
Thank you very much for the job well done.",Positive
"Warm welcome by the staff. Bathroom had a leak and was attended to immediately.

Breakfast was par excellent.

Views from the hotel was spectacular.",Positive
Checking in was great. The minute we pulled up we were greeted with fresh juice and refreshing towelettes. The hotel is located next to a lake and the view is amazing. The rooms were nice with an amazing view of the lake as well. The rooms did look a bit out dated but remember this is an Eco Hotel so this is something that probably does not get done every 2-3 years. The shower also shared the same view of the lake. The piped music is a nice touch. We had a snack in one of restaurants and the food although a bit pricey was very good. The breakfast buffet had a great selection as well. There is a lot of stuff to do at this hotel. I wish we had stayed for more than one night. I will definitely be back to stay there again.,Positive
"Spacious clean room.
Friendly staff with good food.
Incredible building design with creeper over the front and wonderful location",Positive
"We were excited to stay at the famous Geoffrey Bawa hotel. Unfortunately although they had our booking, they didn't seem to know the details and kept asking us for more details.

The rooms were comfortable and would be luxurious with refurbishment. Staff were unfailing courteous but could do with more training so they can provide answers immediately rather than keep having to check.

We'd certainly return especially if they refurbished the hotel. Having wildlife just outside the large windows was special.  ",Negative
We really enjoyed our stay and I wish I could stay more,Positive
"Built into a forested hill side, the hotel is pretty unique. Lovely views and excellent staff makes this a nice place to stay if in the region. It is a long way from any local shops and restaurants and the food and drinks are quite expensive but well worth the stay. Highly recommended.",Positive
"Great property, enjoyed our stay ,amazing hospitality ,good food and entertainment. Hotel is built in a lovely location with lots of facilities.must go and stay here.",Positive
It's our 7th trip to the Kandalama over the past 15 yrs and it never disappoints idyllic place to relax. A must if visiting Srilanka,Positive
"The room and bathroom were big enough and clean.
We enjoyed three different swimming pools.
However, the restaurants have limited choice of menu and the food was not good for what they chareged us.
Only exception was the waffle served in the morning. 

Unfortunately, we stayed only one night so I did not have time to use the sport gym but enjoyed the swimming pool.",Positive
"Amazing architecture. Rooms are beautiful. 3 amazing pools to relax in. Great good at the restaurant, the steak was the best I have had outside Australia. The food is the most expensive we came across which was a bit of a downfall because you can't really go anywhere else to eat because the hotel is so isolated.",Positive
It's fresh to stay in a hotel surrounded by forests. The lake view was fantastic. Dinner buffet was absolutely worth the price.,Positive
It is a grand imposing structure built into the rock with strong ecological awareness.,Positive
Glorious views and lovely rooms. Inside outside feeling of the whole place great infinity pool Close to all sorts of great attractions historical and wildlife,Positive
"We stayed here 10 years ago and loved it and it was even better this time with the kids. The elephant ride was a big hit as were the swimming pools and being surrounded by nature (monkeys, bats, lizards). The staff were very helpful about my daughter's nut allergy and checked with the chefs about ingredients. Overall the hotel is lovely and in a good location for the ancient sites but the big thing that stands out is the amazing service. Worth the price.",Positive
"The hotel itself is quite nice but there is nothing to do there! It would be great place to relax for one night after travelling around Sri Lanka, but if you plan to stay more than 2 nights you will get really bored. There are limited attractions and activities at the hotel. Most people spend their time at the totally overpriced cafe by the pool. The hotel is quite remote and they don't allow tuk-tuks to pick up guest from the hotel. You have to use hotel transport that is very overpriced. My friend and i stayed there for 4 nights and our hotel charges bill was twice as big as the room cost for 4 nights. Expect to pay 10-15 times more for food, drinks, spa, attractions, transport in comparison to costs in Unuwatuna, Merisa or Kendy.",Positive
excellent,Positive
"We booked one night at the Kandalama because of its scenic location and famed architecture. We were not disappointed on these points. However , we found our superior room booked small and dully fitted. Sharp contrast to the hotels large spaces and spectacular architectural details. Mattress quality not up to international standards. Rooms on level 2 with no view. Staff was generally competent and friendly, food was very nice. Our children (5 and 8 years) liked the pools and an evening magician's show, but compared to other places in Sri Lanka, we wouldn't recommend the Kandalama as a particularly child-friendly hotel. Overall too expensive for the high price paid. Having known all of this before, we would probably have visited for a lunch or so and stayed at another hotel in the area.",Negative
Loved loved loved this place. Food was not as good as other lux hotels but we did not care as the place was truly incredible. Never been anywhere like this and really fell in love with it.,Positive
Hotel has very good accommodation and the staff are very welcoming and anxious for you to enjoy your stay,Positive
We stayed at Kandalama for 2 nights of a 2 week holiday in Sri Lanka as it is quite central for a few of the main sites in the cultural triangle and ended up wishing we'd stayed longer. It's a little off the beaten track and the road to the hotel is a bit hard going but it's totally worth it as it really is a beautiful location that feels like it's in the middle of nature.,Positive
"Setting superb if not unique. Bawa architecture is intriguing but stark (and in parts, concrete is crumbling). Service pleasant but can be chaotic eg. we were shown to room by charming staff member but room was not ready and we only discovered various missing items later eg robes, bath mat. Having said all of this, wanted to give it 5 but having come from Oberoi Hotels in India, it was not good enough.",Negative
"The hotel was definitly unique although the triple room was smaller than expected. Breakfast buffet was fantastic. Staff are very attentive and polite. Kids particularly enjoyed the infinity pool with the lake view. Monkeys are really entertaining, especially when they visit your balcony with thier babies. The hotel is quite a way from Damulla but transport not a problem if you dont mind taking a three wheeler. We arranged a three wheeler to collect us too and take us to Habarana. Our driver took us the scenic route down all the back roads which was much more relaxing than the main road.",Positive
Perfect location for a Bawa architecture. Nice inner decoration.,Positive
Overall a very memorable experience,Positive
"This is our first trip to Sri Lanka, this hotel was recommanded by a friend who stayed there 2 years ago. The location and surrounding was great but the hotel is in need of renovation and the staffs at reception area needs to improve their English. We love the Indian Restaurant which only opens in the evening was serving great food. However the main dining room's food was not impressive. I will give it a 4 star for this hotel for Sri Lanka's standard.",Positive
"This hotel lives up to all the amazing things you read and hear for sure! Book early (since they sell out fast) and you won't be disappointed by the room, facilities, service, views, and food! Enuf said...just go!",Positive
"Wonderful location, the eco friendliness of the hotel & surroundings. Wildlife on your doorstep, great views, fantastic swimming pools, wonderful hotel staff, great food, very clean. Adequately close for some of the excursions (e.g. Sigiriya). Got some great romantic settings for special occasions.",Positive
"Very original hotel near the lake and built on a rock, unforgettable experience when you see monkeys on your balcony",Positive
"Beautiful Hotel Location and breath taking scenery with an exquisite cuisine at the buffet .
Lots of food choices for everyone.",Positive
"Very interesting, nice hotel right in the nature, beautiful panoramic views. The staff behaves well, but lacks more helpfulness. Too small drinks selection for 5* hotel. This hotel is suitable for congress tourism rather than for individual stays.",Positive
"A large hotel, but with a personal service. The staff are fantastic, warm and friendly and make sure you want for nothing. The buffet is simply incredible. 
Beautiful location and comfortable rooms. The style of the hotel reflects its age, but this doesn’t prevent them from offering excellent service.",Positive
"Very nice place with beautiful, spacious rooms and jacuzzi in the bathroom.
The service was customerfriendly and the buffet proposed various and several dishes with also live cooking.
Can be recommend ",Positive
Beautiful architecture in forest and great hospitality,Positive
Kandalama was amazing. Super nice service and gorgeous surroundings.,Positive
Great place to relex,Positive
"Overall very friendly staff, had a very tranquil stay. The a la carte dinner I had was superb!

",Positive
"My driver had to wait for over an hour to check in himself, although I had called in advance about the late arrival time(22:30). That was the only thing I felt bad during my stay. ",Negative
Beautiful place. Good food.,Positive
"The hotel is a LONG drive from Colombo and more or less in the middle of the jungle. This means once at the hotel you are more or less at the hotel - but with the Golden Temple of Dambulla about 20 minutes away. The hotel has three restaurants and the buffet restaurant was particularly good. There are three pools (however very few sunbeds!), a cafe/bar and a gym. The staff were very friendly and courteous. The architecture is amazing and the feeling of being in the Sri Lankan jungle complete with monkeys and exotic birds is an experience in itself.",Positive
"It is im no doubt a one of a kind hotel. Amazing views everywhere within and the hotel. Excellent staff and service. Buffet dinner was okay but not great - not enough international food and taste average (but what do you really expect in sri lanka?)

I enjoyed my stay predominany due to its views, location and atmosphere. There are a huge room for improvemeny though - would be great if the road to the hotel is sealed. The bathroom is dated amd esp the toilet is definitely not what you’d expect for a 4 star+ hotel. This is not a cheap hotel. Room assess is via old school key not key card. There isn’t enough power point for mordern living (like even your phone needs to be charged nowaday). But don’t get me wrong I did not regret staying here. It’s just that things can be improved.",Positive
"So nice friendly staff 
I will back to the hotel 
Because this is located in the forest 
so many animal in the hotel and forest  ",Positive
"Although is beautiful, controlled state is bad hotel. Cleaning status was not good. Tile bottom of the room was dirty by dust. And there is no tooth brush. At that time, a housekeeping person knocked door. ""Do you need anything?"" Then, I understood the situation. ""Clean the room, and give me a tooth brush."" I gave him some tip. In this way, he gathered tips.
And the pool, very famous ""Infinity pool"", was dirty. The water smelled strange. It was not the usual smell of pool water. color of the water was unclear. On the bottom of the pool, I saw some black lump. It must be the dung of monkeys.",Negative
Amazing experiece. Just loved the place.,Positive
"I stayed here for 2 nights in Jan 2014. Wish I'd stayed longer. The surrounding landscape and the architecture of the hotel (very integrated in the landscape) is amazing, truly breathtaking. Service is attentive and friendly. Relaxed atmosphere.",Positive
"comfortable bed and pillow, fantastic view, nature friendly building, monkeys, warm attitude people",Positive
