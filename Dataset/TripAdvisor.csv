"What a disappointment! We had heard great things about this hotel, and were excited to visit…. Unfortunately it does not live up to expectations.The building is beautiful and the lake view - incredible. BUT, the hotel is old, the food is average and the decor non-existent. You walk around a building with blank walls, and echoing corridors, to a restaurant with cold, boring, very average food.For the price they charge, this is not worth it. There are plenty of other “special” hotels close by, stay elsewhere.",Negative
"I recently had the opportunity to stay at this hotel and wanted to share my experience. Firstly, I noticed that I was overcharged for the boat trip that I booked through the hotel. The amount billed was significantly higher than the quoted price, which led to some confusion and inconvenience. Additionally, I experienced a couple of maintenance-related issues in my room. The air conditioning unit would not turn off, causing the room to be uncomfortably cold and resulting in a restless night. Consequently, I was awake from 4 am and had difficulty getting the rest I needed. Furthermore, the locker in my room was not functioning properly, which made securing my belongings more challenging than it should have been. These issues combined gave me the impression that the overall maintenance and hospitality at the hotel were somewhat subpar.",Negative
"Came all the way down to my motherland for a holiday. wanted to choose the best hotel to stay in with my family after visiting the eight wonder of the world Seegiriya.Finally, I choose Heritance Kandalama Hotel as it is one of the eco-friendly star hotels in Sri Lanka. This is the second time that I stayed at Heritance Kandalama Hotel. The best hotel I’ve ever been privileged enough to stay at. The gorgeous building and views from the room were amazing. and it only gets more breathtaking when you walk. The rooms were clean, and very comfortable, and the staff was amazing. They went over and beyond to help make our stay enjoyable. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the Central Province in Sri Lanka",Positive
"Large hotel in a beautiful place and an interesting building. It was busy because it was Independence Day and there were a lot of local families staying to enjoy the weekend. So pools were quite busy and the dining rooms were very busy but because food is buffet style this was not much of a problem. The bar was a bit heartless and definitely not the focal point of the hotel, but one of the two days we were staying was a no alcohol day (I believe these occur monthly) so perhaps that was not surprising",Positive
"My wife and I spent 3 nights in Kandalama. Beautiful hotel, perfect fit for the area. Room was spacious and comfortable with views over the lake. Staff were charming. It is an excellent base for Sigiriya, Dambulla, and Ritigala. Hotel is quite isolated which means guests have to eat breakfast and dinner in the large dining room with buffet offer only. Whilst food was generally good this can get a bit tiring and cruise-like.",Positive
"Great location and amazing architecture. This hotel is a role model for environmentally-friendly luxury accommodation. Great views overlooking Kandalama reservoir. Great Sri Lankan hospitality. However, the Buffet does not stack up to 5-star reputation.",Positive
"We stayed here for 3 nights from December 26th-29th. Overall it was a very pleasant stay at Heritance Kandalama. Rooms were comfy and spacious, food was delicious with an extensive menu and pools were serene. We loved our stay but the dining experience was the highlight. We were warmly welcomed by chef Madhusanka and Dinesh along with their executive chef who always made it a point to check on us and see if everything was to our liking. Also Mr. Lalith (guest services manager) was very sweet and welcoming and always checked up on us. We loved this personal touch to our stay and it made it all the more special. My only complaint is that the check in process was slow and we had to wait for about 25 minutes in the lobby without being attended to by one of their front office staff. We felt that the front office staff were a bit on the slow side when it came to attending to their guests. But otherwise it was a lovely stay and we felt rejuvenated at the end of our stay.",Positive
"We forgot to lock the door at the balcony and monkeys had entered our room when we went out and made a real disaster, stolen our baby's milk bottle , biscuits and turned the room upside down. It was our fault, the hotel had already warned on monkeys and they helped us cleaning the room within few minutes of notice. Everything else is smooth,fine and pleasant . We enjoyed the beautiful views and the food. Buffet offered great food but spread was little compared to the price and comparing to the other hotels of lower price. Our baby loved the Christmas decorations a lot.And they had magic show in the evening and a good event planning.",Positive
"A very spacious and unique hotel that is now showing its age. Check-in was efficient. Check-out was painfully slow. Food is good but again, another hotel that serves lukewarm food! Staff are 'hit and miss'. Some were very friendly. Others bordered on being uninterested. Internet is average. This hotel is an interesting one to write on. As a hotel in terms of room amenities and comfort and overall service - it is average. However, its design, location and integration into the wildlife/nature around it means that is is an absolutely must place to stay for a short visit. The nightlife sounds just blew me away - a lifetime memory. I would go back just for the experience of nature. Unfortunately, the price they charge is way too much for an average and aging hotel.",Positive
"The hotel is a must-visit for anyone to experience its uniqueness. The architecture, the views, and the way the hotel blended with nature are some things we have never seen before. However, we felt the hotel badly need a renovation to upgrade the amenities in the rooms, bathrooms, and common areas to be on a similar scale to other hotels charging a similar price. On a positive note, the customer service is top-notch. The staff here is the friendliest I have ever met. They would always go beyond their limit without thinking twice to help customers. Mr. Lalith, the manager of customer affairs - did a great job at helping us and making our experience a great one. He knew how to impress his clients very well. The staff at the reception and the buffet were also very helpful, nice, and caring to us. We would love to visit them again.",Positive
You can't get much closer to nature in this hotel. The architecture is truly in-keeping with the environment and is truly stunning. Even the monkeys pay you a visit but make sure you keep the doors locked as they tried to open ours! Would recommend this hotel for anyone visiting the area and want something a little different. The rooms with the bathtubs overlooking the lake are wonderful! The only complaint I would have is that I would get a room a little further away from the main lobby as due to the layout of the hotel noise carries well.,Positive
Beautiful hotel. The food and restaurant was the most exciting part. The buffet was always something new and something to look forward to. Chef dinesh and his peers were also very kind and helpful and made special orders to suit my dietary needs. 5/5 for the restaurants,Positive
It was good trip for the family. The food was good. The room were very nice. The hotel environment was superb The staff were good. I will recommend my relatives and friends to visit kandalama again. Thanks for the hospitality.,Positive
"Pros- Visiting date 6th august. Room numbers 624,625,626 724,725. Overall the experiance was wonderful. The checkin and checkout was all smooth sailings. Great job front office all staff members. Fnb staff was also really attentive to all our needs special thanks to a memorable birthday. Keep up the excellent work. The food was amazing from the starters till the final cup of coffee just wonderful and a memorable experiance. The pool atandees were attentive and friendly also veryhelpful. The flute session was mesmerizing. Cons- The plates at the main restarnt were worn out a lot of marks on the plates was not pleasing and a little more attention to buffet refiling would be nice ive been here for 20 plus years and i felt that the standards have fallen a little specialy the old plates and worn out bathroom equipment up rooms. Some hand railings were lose and deg. My uncle locked himself out of the room had to take 2 calls and a personal visit to the front desk and almost 20mins for the bell desk staff to find a extra key i bealive. Overall the visit was fantastic and memorable thank you all the best staff of all the hotels ive visited keep up the good work a memorable experiance during these hard times.",Positive
"Very good Location and build near the tank. One of the best architectural designs I’ve seen by Mr. Bawa. The hotel is wedged between the tank and large rock, unbelievable design. This is probably 20 yrs old, but very clean. There was less food than Hilton, but the spread was more than enough. There was some activity every level of the hotel and this make stay pleasant and lively. Staff was very friendly and helpful all the time. Only complaint I had was I was driving from Deep South, Hambantota to hotel, I wanted to have cup of tea. The staff was reluctant to supply at that time near the pool. 2nd time after my dinner, I wanted to have cup of coffee, they were reluctant to serve to the restaurant. The restaurant did not have facilities to provide tea or coffee after dinner. Over all good experiences.",Positive
"This hotel is located in the centre of the forest and is an amazing example of architecture, the hotel is covered in greenery and blends in to the environment, stunning to see. We stayed here for two nights and during our time here a large group consisting of teenage sports teams were also staying here which did impact on the pool areas, resulting in them being busy and a lack of loungers. The hotel is located up a dirt road and is too far away to venture out at night to eat anywhere else but the hotel. Rooms are slightly tired but a decent size with large bathroom. Monkeys appear daily on your balcony so ensure that you follow the rules of keeping your balcony door shut and locked. Lovely location, very isolated and you have to be prepared to drive each day to tour around to the nearby attractions. We went when it was relatively quiet not long after Sri Lanka had lifted Covid restrictions, would not like to be a guest when the hotel was at full capacity as buffet breakfast, dinner and swimming would be a nightmare. Please note that there is a dress code for dinner and breakfast, no shorts, tank tops etc however we found that this was not strictly enforced which was frustrating as we made the effort to adhere to the dress code and turned up to dinner to see people dressed in shorts & a t-shirt. There are signs all around the hotel depicting the required dress code for restaurants and also highlighted to you at check in. Overall a lovely experience if possible try to sit outside for dinner the lights and feeling of being in the middle of nowhere is magical.",Positive
"We transferred to this hotel from Kandy and en route visited Nalanada Gedige and Dambulla Rock Cave Temples. Hotel was nice and convenient stopover for two nights, room was clean and food was great but limited vegetarian options. Facilities were good, includes and 3 pools although we only visited the infinity pool which has a great view of the lake with Sigriya Rock in the background. The following day we visited Sigiriya rock, a must see! We went with one of the registered tour guides and it helps having someone who knows the history in addition to helping the local community.",Positive
"Honest review - a very unique hotel, set in the middle of densely populated green jungle like surroundings and nature (you will see monkeys). About a 15km distance from Dambulla but be warned, if you are flying in from Colombo and this is your first stop (as it was for us), then expect approx 4 hour travel time to get here. We stayed in the deluxe room. Postives- Service of staff very good esp during meals. Unusual open setting and outdoor feel of hotel walkways and common areas.seeing an array of wildlife on the doorstep (monkeys, peacocks, wild rabbits etc). large beds, big bathroom with toilet hose. good quality and selection of food esp breakfast- dedicated chefs to cook specials/ eggs etc. house keeping twice daily",Positive
. Negatives- 4 hour journey from Columbo airport. Dated decor and dated feel of rooms - needs upgrade work to room to refresh. Slippery floor tiles in bathroom and a deep walk over jacquizzi bath/ shower so can be difficult to get in/ out for less mobile. toilet has less flush / feels flimsy. quite isolated from external shops / sights as main areas around 20 mins drive.,Negative
"During our family trip through Sri Lanka we also stayed in the Heritance Kandalama. The location in the middle of the jungle is fantastic. Surrounded only by green trees, a lake and all kind of animals (especially monkeys) is really special. Checkin was simple and fast. The infinity pool was a great way to cool down after the car ride to the hotel and gives great views towards the lake. The rooms and the hotel itself are getting little bit old, which you can see and feel with some of the amenities. However in general it is well maintained. The breakfast is great with many fresh juices, good cappuccino and fresh fruits. We enjoyed it. One night we tried the evening buffet for 6000LKR per person, which was just average. The Western Food like Pasta was ok, but nothing special. The best part was the local curries. But you can eat in other smaller restaurants in Sri Lanka better and cheaper. Besides a great experience, I have one critic point, which happened during checkout. They force you to pay by credit card or in cash by USD only. You cannot use local currency, which was disappointing, as I only needed to settle some drinks and other small expenses.",Positive
"We stayed at the hotel during an Easter break in Sri Lanka so the hotel was super busy, something to note if you’re thinking to stay here. We stayed here for one night and enjoyed our stay. It was a smooth, quick check in and they were also checking temperatures and ensuring we were sanitising our hands, luggage etc.
we were given room 406 which had an AMAZING VIEW of Sigiriya rock. The room was okay, slightly dated and dark, the bathroom definitely needs updating but it was clean. We went down to have some lunch in the cafe area in front of the pool which wasn’t too bad, we had a pizza and chicken wrap were okay. We also had the a la carte dinner at the restaurant in the seventh floor which was mixed. The dessert was absolutely superb, however mains were mediocre. The lobster seasoning was odd, and didn’t taste good, the chicken wasn’t too bad but pretty random when served with a chicken sausage. The breakfast was great, good selection of food plus a live egg, sausage and bacon station.
Beds were super comfortable, and there’s a lot to do in the hotel in terms of walking around, three swimming pools, gym etc.
I would stay here again for sure, maybe would try out the buffet next time.",Positive
Beautiful location and valuable service. Food was excellent. Rooms are very big and clean. The main restaurant staff was very helpful and good service thank you for your hospitality we will come back definitely. We are really enjoy our holiday,Positive
"We stayed here on the first leg of our honeymoon trip. The hotel is lovely and very secluded but surrounded with lots of cheeky monkeys! We did feel the hotel was slightly tired. We stayed in the panoramic room, which unfortunately didn't have much of a view (half the hotel looks out over a lake but the other half doesn't). We were lucky enough to be offered an upgraded room to a Deluxe with a hot tub for our final night. Which was on the other side of the hotel, with a lake view and was fabulous. The staff here were lovely and very tentative to our needs. Food was very tasty and a nice introduction to Sri Lankan food. Plenty of choice at breakfast and dinner, cannot comment on the Western dishes as we stuck to the local Sri Lankan food. Some great opportunities to see elephants near by! Would recommend and would love to stay again!",Positive
An amazing property set in the jungle and hills with amazing sounds surrounding it. The food is just amazing with lots of choices catering for all and amazing flavors. The executive chef was always in the dining hall happy to help and also gave me some recipes! Thank you Nalinda Abeyratne! A must visit if you like the jungle.,Positive
"I spent 3 nights at this hotel (now owned by big Asian tour group Aitken Spence) as part of a group tour of Sri Lanka. My biggest regret was that our tour itinerary, which always ran late, didn't allow us enough free time to enjoy the natural surroundings, wildlife, pools etc of this beautiful hotel - the best on our tour. I could have spent another couple of days just soaking it all up. The very comfortable rooms are furnished in keeping with the architecture and draped externally with plants but although the hotel was practically empty they still gave us the 'cheap seats' with no view of the lake. They could have upgraded us really. The sounds of nature in the morning and evening are a treat and the birdlife is colourful if you stop to watch. You can't sit on the balcony without monkeys coming to see what they can pinch and doors must remain locked shut for the same reason. I went for a walk down the drive but scuttled back, having encountered a snake. There's certainly nature all around! Food wasn't great. A very standard Sri Lankan hotel buffet was the only option for dinner (at 6000 rupees per head) so we went for bar snacks after the first day. The sting in the tail was the growing trend (apparently government-imposed) to give prices in Rupees yet only allow you to pay in US dollars at a disadvantageous exchange rate.",Negative
"Stunning hotel overall, and beautiful views. Love the atmosphere, and the monkeys 🙈. We booked a jacuzzi room however the jets didn’t work, so that was a little disappointing, we lost power on several occasions some days was every 15mins. Buffet was great a little expensive however lots to choose from. Internet in room is good and strong connection. Hotel is out of the main area of Dumbulla, so have to be prepared to eat all meals at the hotel and pay the little higher than normal prices. Staff were friendly and always happy to help.",Positive
"As anyone looking into the hotel would know it's an architectural marvel. I was still mesmerised by how much better it looks in real life. I was there on my honeymoon and the place was definitely the right choice for that. Other than the natural beauty, the place had great activities for the couples: excellent massage options, boat rides, safaris and treks. We could not try some of the treks due to the wild elephants seen in the vicinity. However, we spent four days and not one minute was spent idly. I particularly recommend the Balinese massage and boat ride in the morning. Issues: The service was slightly uneven with very prompt service was sometimes followed by unattended calls. With weekend and valentines day, the eateries were a bit overcrowded. There was some issue with my card on one instance and it turns out they did not have any other payment options than POS. The vegetarians might find the menu a bit inclined towards non vegetarians. All in all, I would recommend the place wholeheartedly. most of the issues in hindsight can be placed on understaffing due to covid times. The place was a good old fashioned five star with a legacy and beautiful architecture. That's what I expected and I was not disappointed.",Positive
"Me and my partner stayed here for 2 nights over a 4 week visit in Sri Lanka. The hotel is architecturally beautiful! Draped in foliage, surrounded by jungle on the edge of a breathtaking lake - The views were incredible! All the rooms have a private balcony with a choice of lake or garden. Ours was lake which was lovely however we met a couple staying in a garden view who saw elephants right outside their room in the hotel grounds at dawn. 2 of the 3 pools were open during our visit and we loved the natural pool. The cocktails were great (but beware of leaving them unattended because it will soon attract the monkeys!) The food was probably the most average throughout our stayed which was a little disappointing for a 5 star hotel. We ate better in all the guesthouses we stayed in. The views are the best thing about this hotel, it was a great place to spend 2 days by a nice pool after a lot of hiking but thats it",Positive
"Visited the heritance with my family on 22nd and stayed up until 26th December ..stayed in rooms 508 509 510.. The rooms were lavish with jacuzzis and all the other basic needs but its the mesmerizing view of lake AMAYA from the balcony which seals the deal for these rooms..room service is quick and fast.. Unlike the previous visits- the room mini refrigerators were empty and the buffet was served by the staff( due to COVID-19 pandemic)..food too was not exceptional unlike our last visit 3years back except on the Christmas night dinner gala where an extraordinary effort was made to make the experience at the hotel special.. There are 3 swimming pools.. A gym.. A library.. A spa... But no other extra-activities to keep you entertained (at least a chance to play billiards would have done wonders) .. A group of musicians do come for dinner to play which does help light up the ambience .. Kandalama heritance is an ideal place to visit the Dambulla Golden temple, Sigiriya lions rock, Pidurangala rock, Habarana eco park.. The purpose of a vacation is to be pampered, to relax and the staff is an integral part of ensuring this.. Some names that stood out with their services were Janaka and Dimuth(waiting tables at the buffet), Vishan (room cleaning service), Rasika and Chamara(at the lobby), Mr Lalith, Jayalath, Gamini and Purakrama..thank you for making this trip special with your exceptional service.. Most of the time all required safety measures against Covid-19 were being followed which was reassuring...all in all had a memorable time..",Positive
"Beautiful tranquil setting, very sympathetically designed to blend into the landscape - you can hardly see this hotel from the other side of Kandalama lake. Had a very natural feel with outdoor stair wells and corridors so you felt nestled within the jungle. Monkeys on the balconies which was a great fun twist! Due to the design, there is a lot of walking from one end of the hotel to the other. 2 of pool areas could do with improvement - a bit scruffy and difficult walking between them. Muddy and rocky. But the views unbeatable. The 3rd pool was great for the afternoon but again the area could be tidied up a bit. We ordered cocktails but they took an age to come. Service definitely with a smile though! The rooms themselves were great - felt authentic and colonial, lots of solid dark wood (lighting could be improved though) however the plug sockets were a challenge. Many not upgraded so difficult to charge phones. Buffet dinner was good although much more expensive (3,000 rupees) than other hotels (1,500) but possibly due to remote location. The under cover outdoor BBQ completely smoked out the diving room one eve which made eating unpleasant. The food was good however (I mainly ate local curries, many other options available) and the breakfast buffet was great. There were a few power cuts which is apparently very common to the area. The bar/Al a carte restaurant area was again quite dark but perhaps this is due to blending in with nature. Service also good. Staff friendly. Would defo recommend for the experience! We did day trips to Sigiriya rock (45 mins each way), Pollonaruwa (2 hours each way) and Damnula rock cave temples (near by) from from here.",Positive
"We came here on the rector a friend. The hotel is beautiful and location amazing. However, we would say that the rooms are dated. Hard to figure out the power switches because most of them are behind the bed. Room service was great and timely. Very reasonable. We’d stay here again.",Positive
Location of the hotel is so good..architecture of the hotel is very beautiful...credit go to great Geoffrey Bawa..facilities of the rooms are ok...foods offer at restaurant buffet are limited but very tasty...chef was excellent..if spread was improved its the best buffet in country..cleanliness and hygiene was good...overall its a great experience 👌,Positive
"Hotel along with comfortable rooms and excellent service. And the staff are friendly and helpful. Service was excellent! Only one disadvantage problems with meals. Various of food items was in buffet but not delicious, hope soon it will be solved.",Positive
"Decided to visit for a short stay. Arrived around 3 PM after a long drive from colombo, checking in was OK given all the pandemic precautions. We were escorted to a location next to the pool and welcome drinks offered while the self declaration paperwork on health were filled up. Rooms were on the further end and were Initially disappointing. They were facing the car park. And it was quite a distance to the restaurant. There is a shuttle to the car park from the lobby. That's how far. Since my parents were elderly and walking from one end to the other wasn't the best for them. We spoke to the front desk and moved our rooms to be closer to the restaurants. Samith from the front deck was understanding and immensely helpful. Thank you Samith! The hotel is very vast and peaceful, lots of greenery and amazing views of the lake, Sigiriya in a distance and all round foliage. The food was good thought out our stay and the staff helpful and friendly. The rooms did look a bit dated but then again this is a 25+ year old hotel. Overall a good experience",Positive
"We stayed two nights in early March, it was a bit busy with it being a weekend, the staff were pretty courteous and helpful most of the time, many of the guest though were very inconsiderate when it came to maintaining social distance during pandemic, especially when it came to the buffet. The pools were mostly unused and we managed to use them in isolation for hours. The room service orders for lunch were excellent and we enjoyed eating without the rush of greedy guests. The rooms are now a bit dated and the pillows need changing. The buffet was a bit monotonous. All in all was a good relaxing break in nature.",Positive
"Food was great and the service from the staff never had any issues, even when we first visited the property 12 years back. The fact that nature is right next to your room has always been great. Kids enjoyed the pool and the walk around the huge facility.",Positive
This hotel was opened somewhere in late 19's and now it is a bit of an old-fashioned hotel. this should have refurbished. however still their prices are expensive. The hotel still looks nice and the surrounding forest is amazing,Positive
"We booked the Deluxe Room for 2 nights. Kandalama has one of the best views overlooking Kandalama lake. We were located at Sigirya Wing, which had 2 pools. 5th floor infinity pool has nice views of Kandalama Lake. Also the pool deck of 7th floor has amazing sunset views. Hotel is very close to nature & has lot of places to explore. Food was amazing since we had the buffet which was huge & had many selections. Staff were friendly, helpful & polite. Regarding the room, we paid close to 72,000 for both nights & we felt like rooms are not worth it. They had okay furniture & amenities but not as luxury as they say. Bathroom only had a tub, which was okay with us but kind of inconvenient if you want to have a quick shower. Other than that we loved the stay and even reconsider coming back.",Positive
"Unique hotel in the middle of a jungle by the side of the lake. View from the room and the bath room was amazing. Front desk team was very friendly but F&B team didn’t give the same impression. Not sure they could cope up with overwhelming crowd. Food quality and variety was very good. Maintenance in side the rooms could be better. We definitely will visit again,",Positive
Nice garden and enjoyed the infinity pool. Average room amenities. I expected more room facilities considering the reputation. Good food and service from buffet. Could use more recreational activities without overcharging,Positive
The location is perfect and unique. It feels like staying amidst a lush forest facing an enormous lake.There is no place to beat the architecture of this property. However the hotel could improve on their amenities and service,Positive
"Place is good. The lake and the scenery. But rooms are tiny. I recommend Water Garden for the same price. Food is ordinary. Not really a five star taste like Anantara and Water Garden. The price is much more expensive considering the rooms. We had the room with spa bath. Monkeys are around the area, my kid likes it.",Positive
"The food is amazing and the staff is probably the best in the Island. The rooms are spacious and views are astounding. on the minor side, Washrooms badly needs renovation and the access roads aren't that good...",Positive
"Staff was very welcoming and kind, Hotel location was really good and in close proximity to the lake Kandalama. Only headache was the Monkeys, had to keep out of the balconies and the open areas. Food choices were good but international food can improve if you are looking at a local (Sri Lankan) perspective. Overall it was a good experiance, the hotel is closer to 1Km long.",Positive
"As always, it’s a great hotel situated on stunning location in front of kandalama lake. Spacious rooms & amenities. Staff is helpful & setting everything based on the new normal standards. Restaurant is nicely done & food is mouth watering",Positive
We visited the hotel in crowded weekend and staff was friendly in the check-in procedure. Room is spacious and you can see the beautiful Kandalama lake from the Balcony. Natural pool int he 7th floor was not cleaned but the infinity pool was good. They were running with reduce staff in the restaurant long queue were there in the buffet. Food varieties were limited in the buffet. Very poor breakfast buffet. I requested from several restaurant staff to bring me a finger bowel I received it after half an hour and at that time my fingers are totally dried out with leftover foods.,Negative
I went with my wife on our honeymoon to Heritance Kandalama. Excellent location which is very close to nature. We had the best view from our room which was in the sigiriya wing. Although we both felt that the rooms are a bit crammed up. Food was great. Had the best cup of tea after breakfast a hotel had offered. You need at least 2 nights at the hotel to get the minimum experience the hotel has to offer. There are so many outdoor activities to do during the day time but night is usually dull. Excellent Covid 19 safety precautions.,Positive
"I booked one of their best rooms availabe. A ""Luxury King"" room facing Sigiriya wind. But only myseld King was there without luxury. It is surrounded by tress, rocks and a lake. But there was nothing to experience except great meals, pool and the lake view. Food were really great. One of the best tasty food were there. Overall cleanliness was very bad. Tiles, walls were too much old. Leaking taps, old door windows, out-dated wood finish were there. You'll never experience a 5 star quality there. Recently I visited a 4 star hotel in Dubai, Called ""TRYP by Wyndham"". We should rate it 7 stars compared to this ""Heritance Kandalama"". Staff were amazing at Kandalama, They always do care us and control their quality of service. But don't expect a luxury experience. everything is old and outdated. It is almost to be broken down on to the floor.",Negative
"We stayed here for 2 nights (26th & 27th July) after lockdown (Room 505 & 506). If you're coming here for great service and great natural landscaps, then yes this is the place. The staff are excellent and always with smiling faces and go out of their way to make you feel comfortable. Food is not the best thing here. Limited variety - food is good, but not great. Dinner on the 26th was buffet with decent variety, but on the 27th it was alacarte. The staff were considerably low on the 27th and that was understandably visible in their service. There were only 24 pax and that meant the service was lagging behind and the staff were confused and made us confused too. We came here after staying 2 nights each at Jetwing Yala & Jetwing Lighthouse and you could easily say both the Jetwing hotels outweigh far higher than Kandalama Hotel in terms of food and variety. If you love nature - then you MUST come here. There is nothing like this hotel in Srilanka. It's one of it's kind. This hotel houses the 1st infinity pool of Srilanka. It's hard to believe Mr Bawa came up with this conception in 1985...such a forward thinker! It's inside a jungle and you get that feeling especially when it rains. If you're looking for a luxury hotel inside the jungle...then this is it! A few niggles though.. 1) Jaccuzi fittings are old and corroded. Some of the bath fitting also are showing their age. 2) No extra power sockets to charge phones/tablets. You have to disconnect the lamp shade or kettle to charge. How stupid. 3) Even though there was a smart casual dress code for dinner, none of the locals adhered to it. Locals turned up to dinner with shorts, slippers and skinnies. What a shame, the staff couldn't care any less either. I would have rather had my dinner in room",Positive
The staff is very friendly and supportive. They have taken very good measures against COVID 19. But there are issues in maintenance of the rooms. The varieties of food items to be improved in the buffet. The classical band was very entertaining! ,Positive
"We stayed at the Heritance for 3 nights when visiting the area to see Sigiriya Rock. The hotel is constructed into the hillside and has been literally taken over by the undergrowth, giving a unique feel with local wildlife living side by side with guests. Absolutely amazing to see the monkeys playing in the hotel grounds and structure, often appearing on room balconies. We had a very comfortable and enjoyable 3 nights here. The staff were extremely friendly and attentive. F&B was excellent and very well priced. We particularly enjoyed their buffets at breakfast and in the evening. As stated above, this hotel is an ideal location if visiting Sigiriya Rock as only about 15 minutes by car. If I were to be at all critical I would say that certain areas of the hotel need attention. I can understand that the exterior upkeep is nigh impossible to be kept perfect due to its design and location in the hillside. However I could see things requiring attention that you wouldn’t expect in a 5* hotel - the white toilet seat in room was secured with pink brackets. Such a small cost to replace if it had been broken but clearly looked like a make-do repair.Overall a great hotel that is worth considering in this area.",Positive
"We stayed at Heritance Kandalama for 5 nights at the beginning of March 2020. The hotel itself is beautiful, is in a wonderful setting, and has an abundance of wildlife. The hotel itself is in need of an update - the last refurbishment was in 2005 and in our opinion is now overdue. Certain parts of the rooms are tired - for example the tap in the sink which had clearly broken and been glued back together. The “welcome” book in the room was also old/dirty and out of date - it states that there are travel adapters and mosquito pads in the bedside tables, but there are not. In the grand scheme of things though the standard of the hotel was ok as the wonderful setting made up for the building being a bit tired. The biggest issue and inconsistency that we had was with the staff and fundamental lack of basic communication. In fact the most friendly staff by a mile were the housekeeping staff - they would always smile and say hello. The cafe bar staff were also nice. We found the reception staff and restaurant staff mostly cold and unwelcoming and did not explain anything. When we checked out, for example, there wasn’t a single question about whether we enjoyed our stay - we were just directed to the cashier to pay our bill and were told “you can check out over there”. No pleasantries at all. At dinner (in the restaurant - buffet) we were not told how much it would cost and the fact that it was all self-service was not explained. There is no attempt made by staff to up-sell at all - if you don’t ask then don’t expect to be asked! Our glasses would run dry and be cleared away and we wouldn’t be asked if we wanted another drink - strange. Heritance Kandalama prides itself on being at one with the environment and Aitken Spence produces its own water for consumption in the hotel. There is absolutely no excuse that this water is provided in PLASTIC bottles - water should either be provided in a jug in the room or in glass bottles. Even if the plastic is recycled it should not be produced in the first place - there is no excuse. During our stay we rented bicycles from the hotel and cycled around the Kandalama reservoir to Kaludiya Pokuna archaeological site. It’s quite a long trip (around 20 miles round trip) but worth it - it’s the first place we’ve visited where we were the only people there (probably because it’s difficult to get to other than on a bicycle). The bicycles were good but we were quoted two different prices by reception and were not provided with any water or maps of cycle routes (we made our own route on Google maps). I would have expected more - bicycle rental at 2,000 LKR should include a bottle of water and map of local cycle routes. The dress code at dinner is ridiculous. You are effectively required to wear trousers to a buffet dinner, yet there are children running around playing Sonic on their iPads. Effectively Heritance Kandalama is trying to enforce a dress code for a fine dining restaurant when this is effectively a family buffet. That said, the quality of the food was beautiful and the chefs clearly care a lot about what they do - we cannot fault the food (if you do go for the buffet, try to get a table outside). On our final night, staff randomly appeared with surgical masks, presumably as a result of the global coronavirus crisis. This was a little unsettling though as no explanation was given for the change in stance from breakfast - at first we thought that someone staying in the hotel might be ill, but then it was explained when I asked that in fact it was because there had been a case in Colombo! So overall that’s minus 1 star for inconsistent service, minus 1 star for tiredness of the hotel, but plus 1 star for the wonderful setting. I would strongly suggest that Aitken Spence provide adequate training to staff in terms of what it really means to work in a guest service environment - explain every last detail and leave room for no ambiguity.",Negative
"The views are spectacular from the hotel, you face jungle, the lake and you can see Sigiriya standing out in the distance from were our room was situated. Fantastic! The room was super spacious but the bathroom, now that was the gem of the suite. The jacuzzi tube situated by the large private window that overlooked the aforementioned views amazing! The monkeys are also a great experience as you can see them often hanging about the outside of the hotel.",Positive
"Heritable Kandalama is a gem not to be missed! Built into the side of a mountain overlooking a lake this hotel is one with nature. Every room has a balcony overlooking the lake. There are birds chirping, monkeys playing, lemurs in the trees. The whole place is an open air concept beautifully designed. The infinity pool and grounds are stunning. The staff are very attentive. Breakfast was a good buffet selection. Lunch choices in the cafe are Westernized food mainly. The rooms could use a bit of a facelift, bathroom while clean doesn’t feel it because of hardened water stains etc. The bed was comfortable. We used this as a jumping off point to do an early am Sigiriya Rock climb and it was great. I would recommend making sure you have a few days to just relax here as it is so peaceful and lovely!",Positive
"A stunning hotel, with an incredible view. The service is second to none and the food in both on-site restaurants is delicious. The negative takeaway though is the accommodation provided for the drivers. For such an excellent hotel which takes so much care of it’s customers, it was very disappointing to hear the same care is not taken of the drivers staying at the hotel. Hopefully this is something the hotel can consider and improve upon in the future.",Positive
"The Heritance Kandalama is as beautiful and different as everyone says! We had a great stay here, a really different hotel like nowhere we have been before. The rooms are an ok size but the bathroom is huge with an amazing shower. We were lucky to get upgraded and had views in front and at the side of our room - the monkeys on the terrace made it fun too! Breakfast was one of the best I have had with lots of options. Staff in general are very helpful and efficient too. We spent some time at the pool, the views are breathtaking over the lake. Our only downside is that the restaurant has a smart casual dress code, men must be in trousers - this isn’t normally a problem but we packed light and hence couldn’t eat in either of the main dining rooms. We did have food at the pool bar and that was good enough for us. The rooms in general need a bit of a tidy up, they are clean but the curtains and hotel book are a bit rough around the edges. Despite that, we would go back in a heartbeat.",Positive
"This place is meant to be an architectural wonder and was created by the famous Bawa. If you like lots of black marble effect, grey concrete and metal fencing then this is your place. It was not our bag in its bleak appearance. However it has charming and helpful staff, absolutely delicious food with lots of variation every day. There are also 3 good swimming pools. The staff go beyond the call of duty to help you . An example is Madusanka who delighted us by creating elephants and monkeys out of our towels! The staff can also organise trips to the ancient cities and other locations . And you are dependent on them because this hotel is miles from anywhere . The hotel has a good eco policy and recycled water waste etc and it has an eco park you can visit . HOWEVER, it dioes need to get rid of the 100s if not 1000a of plastic bottles it supplies you for water. One each or a glass one would be fine for you to fill it from tanks of fresh water",Positive
"The hotel is beautiful and huge, the location is amazing, there are rooms where you get a view of both the Sigiriya Rock and the Dambulla Cave Temple. The rooms are spacious , however , a lot of monkeys coming in the balcony , it is totally surrounded by nature. The lobby has a beautiful view and the pools are lovely as well. Few rooms have Jacuzzi with views of the Kandalama lake. We went during Chinese New Year and we were not happy with the dinner buffet. That was the only con to our stay. Otherwise it is a superb property.",Positive
"A very good hotel from the architecture, comfort, food and sercice point of view. We throroughly enjoyed our stay there - only one night. Because of the way in which it is ""draped"" on the mountainside there is a bit of distance to walk between the rooms and the common facilities, but it gives yoiu a good opportunity to appreciate the archtitecture. Food choice and quality excellent, everything else very good",Positive
"We almost didn’t stay at this hotel because of some of the negative comments in previous reviews but I am so glad we took the chance. I agree the hotel is on the older side which is somewhat evident in the rooms but I have stayed at plenty of 5 star hotels and if you look too closely at the corners and crevices they are never perfect. What makes this hotel special is the design and serene environment. It was architecturally designed to blend in with the environment, beautifully set against a mountainside in the jungle overlooking a reservoir. Vines partly camouflage the exterior and provide climbing frames for the wild monkeys. It was a real treat to see these funny creatures just outside our balcony. The service provided by the staff was top class. I feel this hotel has been unfairly underrated and I almost didn’t stay here because of it which would have been a real shame. I’m only sorry I didn’t stay a third night.",Positive
"We stayed at the Heritance Kandalama as part of our honeymoon. The hotel on arrival is so impressive, overlooking the reservoir and set into the greenery. The check-in process was great and the staff were so attentive after a long drive from Colombo. On getting to our first room which was upgraded we were a little disappointed, it was dark and whilst we overlooked Sigiriya rock the room felt a little cramped and very old. As the room wasn’t great we asked to move and got downgraded to a panoramic room which was much better, the window was the full width of the room and it was very private. The room was again very old, the desk had lots of chips in the wood, and worktops were worn and tired. The bathroom was good with a bath and huge walk in shower. In a 5* hotel I expect soft luxurious bath towels, the towels at the hotel were so old they were more like sand paper than soft, I’ve had better quality towels in premier inn hotels. The main restaurant is great, the food is excellent at breakfast and dinner and there is plenty of choice. The cost is reasonable for a hotel and the service in the restaurant is brilliant. The views overlooking the lake are great. The infinity pool has the best views of the reservoir and is definitely the best pool. The only thing that I can say about the pool is that there isn’t much space for sun beds around the pool. Overall, the Heritance Kandalama is a great hotel and well worth staying at for the location of visiting sigiriya rock, Dambulla caves and elephant safaris, just don’t expect the 5* luxury of normal spa hotels. The service is definitely 5*.",Positive
"Came highly recommended by a friend to stay in this luxurious /5-star hotel but the feel doesn’t give that feel at all. The rooms look aged and it’s time for refurbishment. For a luxurious hotel, it doesn’t give much amenities. We even had one power failure which explains the candle in the room. Nonetheless the staff are friendly and helpful, although few of them require more training. There are 3 pools but generally see people swimming in the 5th floor pool. However it gets too busy and noisy. The pool next to the dining hall doesn’t look very clean with leaves in them and lots of monkeys surrounding the pool. I actually saw a monkey drinking from the pool. Limited dining options and the buffet dinner gets really busy when the hotel is full. The dining staff seem to be overwhelmed with the volume of guests that service becomes lacking. Food was average too.",Negative
"Enjoyed our stay here. The pros were the setting of the hotel, it’s cleanliness and the views. It was sometimes hard to get a bed by the pool as there were nowhere near enough compared to the number of rooms. The place lacks a little bit of atmosphere in the evenings. Really recommend going to the non buffet restaurant- the curry and rice is excellent. We were unfortunately there during the Easter bombings. And the staff were very professional and supportive in such hard times for them",Positive
"I returned to this hotel recently after staying there previously 10 years ago. So well designed and despite being a large hotel we never felt crowded and once in the room you feel completely alone and at one with nature. It really is a very special place and Bawa did a great job designing it! We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a suite, however the regular rooms still have a fantastic view and the wow factor. The only negative is the food, we tried the restaurant this time and sadly the food was not up to standard - we have had much better food at the Heritance in Negombo. The buffet option looked better and next time we will opt for this. All in all a great stay and a hotel to be experienced whilst touring this beautiful country.",Positive
Stayed for 3 nights over Christmas so the hotel was super busy but apart from meal times it never felt crowded or noisy. The hotel is amazing when you consider where it is and how it is nestled into the granite mountain side. Long polished concrete corridors weave inside and out to the resident wings. Well appointed and comfortable rooms looking out over the water offer wonderful views at dawn and dusk. Beware the macaques - they are clever and will try to get into your room. Friendly staff. The snack dining menu was the only a la carte option during our stay but it had some good choices.,Positive
"My husband and I just spent three nights at Heritance Kandalama. Very interesting place - I’m not sure what my overall rating should be. The hotel is certainly very impressive, looming out of the jungle and is like nowhere else I’ve stayed. Huge, long corridors, not very cosy and the public spaces like bars and restaurants are so huge that they make you feel slightly like you’re in an airport. The view is sensational IF you get one of the rooms facing the lake - we booked a Suite which was billed as a lake view and high floor, but the room actually faced the jungle/cliffs which made it quite dark, though still very interesting particularly if you enjoy being so close to nature. We asked if we could move to the other side, and were upgraded to a really lovely suite on the top floor facing the lake. So plus points there. The building is definitely showing its age. They have a constant battle to keep the jungle out of the hotel, and it’s definitely eating away at the hotel, with cracks in the concrete, some windows in need of repair/cleaning and a slightly dated feel. But it is still characterful and really an impressive sight. Just don’t go expecting something cutting edge. Restaurant is a buffet which is of decent quality. Three very nice swimming pools. Service seems a bit slack sometimes, the checkin in a rather strange procedure which didn’t feel very warm. It was nice to see that the hotel guests were maybe 75% locals. Overall a mixed bag but certainly a unique experience and we would return.",Positive
"This icon hotel is a must see. Beautifully mingled with nature be it rocks, forest or lake. Staff and facilities are excellent. Food is exceptional good. One suggest regarding room choice; ask for higher floors and in dambula wing facing the lake which has the best views. The other wing is called sigiriya to my opinion facing trees and partial lake view is not that great. Max 2 nights is sufficient to cover touring dambula",Positive
"We stayed here for 5 nights as part of our honeymoon. Very peaceful hotel surrounded by lovely views. Plenty of choice at the buffet and the food at kaludiya restaurant was fantastic and excellent service. We were upgraded to a suite as we were on honeymoon which was a lovely treat. A special thank you to Vishan and Indika for the excellent job they did cleaning our room and leaving special touches for us - thank you. Lots of wildlife to see around the hotel - monkeys, lizards, squirrels etc. Would recommend for a peaceful and relaxing break.",Positive
Having stayed at the sister hotel in Negumbo this is very different - built into environment on the side of rocks and in the jungle it is certainly unique - well positioned for the cultural triangle and sight of Sigiriya Rock - some how though not personal and though our room was very large with monkeys outside the window it did not have a warm feeling - however all was satisfactory - the buffet restaurant was large but good and we really enjoyed the barbecue element to the rear at both meal times - pretty good but very busy when large parties arrived - the weathered not allow us to use the in finite pool but a pool to the side was good,Positive
"My family and I went for the Lunch Buffet at Kanchana Restaurant of Heritance Kandalama. We also used the pool for many hours as it was also included in the buffet ticket. Food: Really good. The starters and mains were exceptionally good. The vegetables were fresh and the dishes were well matched. The starters included many cheese varieties, famous salads, cold meats, and sushi (vegetarian). While the sushi was just average, the others were great! Mains were divided as Srilankan and International Buffet. Desserts covered a massive area of the buffet. The highlighting factor was the number of fresh fruits they offered. (You can see all these in the pictures) Pool Access: We used the common pool that is in the 5th floor. Later, I was told later by another guest that the hotel has 3 more pools. I was not aware of this fact as the staff did not informed us about this. We used the pool for 2 hours. It's shallow end was 3 feet high while the deep end had a sharp transition from the shallow end and was more than 6 feet. The pool faced the Sigiriya and was great for photo shoots. Service:The staff was extremely friendly and would engage in normal conversation to keep you entertained and inform about the hotel in a more informal manner. They promptly take away the empty plates and clean the tables smoothly without causing a nuisance to the nearby seaters. Hotel and Ambience: The hotel is famous for capturing the nature and it's inhabitants as it is without harming the appearance of a small jungle near a lake. The view is awesome as you can see the famous Sigiriya and Pidurangala across the lake while having your meal. Price: The buffet was LKR 4000.00 per person. This was the only downside of this experience as when I inquired about the buffet over the phone, I was told it was LKR 3000.00. I am not sure what increased the price. Verdict: I loved the food and I loved the place! Will visit them soon.",Positive
"When you drive up to this property it's difficult to believe how just exquisite the architecture is. The three swimming pools, reception area, reading rooms and the property grounds are built straight into the hillside. I don't think I've ever been to a hotel that has better architecture than the Heritance Kandalama. The rooms and overall 'feel' of the hotel however left us wanting. There is no sense of coziness in any of the places. This hotel is 25 years old and you can sense that in some of the places. Rooms while spacious aren't exactly screaming 5-star (which the prices are). And the dining options, pool area and hotel bar are rather lacklustre. Rooms didn't have hair conditioner, the mini bar was poorly stocked and the sofa didn't even have cushions. If the management put in as much effort as the architect this could truly be one of the most special hotels in the subcontinent. The food is good though!",Positive
"You have to stay here when visiting Sri Lanka. It's all about nature and elegance. I loved the naughty monkeys, the lush green gardens, the pools, the food - great breakfast, great cocktails, friendly staff. Unfortunately service here was very slow on average 45 min wait and our room could be updated with mouldy blinds and shower. I highly recommend the cooking demonstration and tour, this place has an amazing kitchen and a great chef, thanks guys.",Positive
"The hotel is one of the best in Sri Lanka with nice in many ways including service, comfort, food and staff. Good for any type - we had 260 people in our group - and they give their best attention and service.",Positive
"Lovely hotel that is literally part of the landscape. Light airy rooms with great views across the lake, even from the shower! Friendly bar and terrace with attentive staff, quiet surroundings with plenty of wildlife to observe.",Positive
"We spent 2 nights at the hotel, the product is great, the location is amazing (literally in the Jungle) / the service was great, the spa was also a great experience but a bit overpriced comparing it to other hotels in Sirilnaka. The food quality was average, but overall the experience was great! A lot of insects in the room, harmless though.",Positive
Excellent property!! Infinity pool time is one gud reason.. wid rock pool on top.. gud staff n d cooperative chef!! Hotel situated in a jungle is super place for ones who r adventurous.. a must go place in Dumbulla!!!!!,Positive
The hotel is situated along the coast of a large lake/reservoir. Built into the cliff with vines on the outside. Great views of the lake from our bedroom. You’ll also see Monkeys wandering around outside. The rooms could do with modernising a little. Was very dark in the rooms. And just a refresh would make them nicer. Food was great in the breakfast buffet. And we ate in the a la carte Restaraunt in the evening.,Positive
"Surrounded with Lush Green Jungle & Kandalama lake which really adding value of relaxing & enjoying with nature. Swimming pool & other facilities need may development & Monkeys are the real issue during stay, you cannot open the windows which certainly they are accessing to your room. Which happened to me. Dinning & restaurants are really pleasant and the service staff also really professional. Recommend to have peaceful outing and worth for spend.",Positive
The hotel is picturesquely blended with the surroundings and is one of the best features I have observed throughout the stay.Widely spread walk ways across the hotel gives mush pleasant views of the Kandalama lake and the surrounding jungleFriendly staff who reached out to assist us on all our needs. The restaurant was quite packed all the time but the quality of food is superb with many options to suit our needs.I have observed that the rooms need a modernization as there are obvious signs of wear out of the furniture and fittings. Overall we all enjoyed the pleasant stay in this hotel.,Positive
"This was my second visit to Heritance Kandalama. I first went there when i was a teen (year 2004) and had a best time. Food was amazing and that was the biggest buffet i have ever seen. So i had the same expectation in my recent visit. This time i visited with my Husband and family. Hotel staff warmly welcomed us. We checked in at 2.30 p.m but we got our room after 1.5 hours which was very disappointing. Only me and my husband got a double room and my other family members got triple rooms. We got the room 319 and which was a horror movie. It was the last room in that floor which was separated from all the other rooms. It was a very tiny room with a small bathroom, No bathtub & It looked like it was never cleaned. Balcony was so tiny that 2 people can barely fit in. It had a huge CRT Television (i was shocked) set on a table. I felt like crying because i was that angry. we complained hotel staff and they changed our room to 305, which was better. But it really needs a renovation, everything is same as in my last visit which was basically 15 years back, and all the bathroom fittings looks old. Bathtub drain doesn't seal which was again a disappointment. Our bed quilt had a huge iron burn on it which we ignored because we didn't want to complain everything. Pools were okay we didn't use natural pool (kaludiya) cz we had kids and it was slippery. Our first meal there was the dinner buffet and it was average. It wasn't like in my last visit, varieties were very less. But it was okay. Then next day's breakfast was good, food was tasty, Lunch was the one which i really liked. It had a huge variety. Overall meals were tasty, it was that the varieties were less. Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. I noticed many so many negative things may be cz i compared this visit with my last visit. I had high expectations this time but which didn't met. Our overall experiences were okay, we had fun.",Positive
"Kandalama is a great hotel with large land & beautiful structure. It's cover with forest & beautiful nature. Check-in was fast and helpful. They welcome us warmly. They take a long time to deliver the luggage to the rooms. It's around 30 min. Room was old. This was my 3rd time to Kandalama & rooms were not good than previous times. We found some patches in sofas & carpets. The bed was luxurious & the bathroom was good with all amenities without hand shower. The architecture of the hotel was great. We can see the beauty of nature from the room. Eco-park was really nice & had to walk around 1km from hotel to the eco-park. Food was delicious with a good spread. They had Sri Lankan food corner also. They had two pool & I used only one pool near to the 3rd-floor residences. That pool was not friendly to children & height start from 4' 8"". They had a gym but many types of equipment not working. They had 3 thread miles but only worked 1. Can't adjust the weight of total gym equipment. I think the hotel should do a renovation ASAP. Recommended hotel for all.",Positive
"Good facilities and great views. this is a more self containing resort experience. I love the small touches like having a flute guy play during the end of the day around the pool area; with the view, it made for a good ambiance. To go outwards from the hotel to other sites would require a car/tuk tuk which is not available on site. You can use the hotel to get you transport but that would be quite expensive.",Positive
"Superb location. Quiet and serene nature of this hotel was the exact experience I was looking for. Incredibly friendly staff made our stay more comfortable hence they deserves the full credit. Food was great and the Infiniti pool was something extraordinary. Only downside was the little mixup happened while making a change to our booking that would have avoided with little bit of attention. Other than that, it was an excellent experience.",Positive
Due to the English cricket team confirming their Kandy schedule at the last minute the hotel was overbooked at Kandy and we were asked if we could be accommodated at Heritance Kandalama instead. It was a good decision eventually even though we were skeptical initially. The property is huge with excellent food options including vegetarian. The only drawback is that there are many monkeys around and one cannot keep the balcony door open to enjoy the view in the tastefully done up rooms. Nonetheless the view of the forest is beautiful even with the closed windows. Nearby places of interest which one could visit are the Sigiriya Rock Face and Pollunoruwa ruins which were amazing. Anuradhapura is also one of the places or can visit from here along with the options for a few national parks to sight elephants in the wild.,Positive
"Stayed for three nights in hotel and because of recent events there were very few guests on first night. Choice of two pools, one an infinity pool the other a natural pool built into the rock. The construction of the resort is amazing in the way it fits into the environment. The staff were very welcoming and thankful to us for continuing our tour of Sri Lanka and were always smiling and laughing.",Positive
We went on a short get away and the location is just amazing. Climber plant climbing in the balcony and just gives the feel that you are sitting inside the jungle. Ofcourse monkeys keep visiting. To thee possible extent they preserved the nature including the huge rocks which was integrated to buildings,Positive
"I have been to this hotel , probably ten times or more. It never fails to amaze me with the architecture and the staff attitude,However I did notice that the Housekeeping staff were talking in the local language , talking and joking .In normal hotels this is to be expected , but Kandalama always oozed that certain class in the sense that the staff were always seen but not heard. The food I must say was exquisite, there was a bit of something for everyone. The hotels chef staff were always a cut above the rest, especially the pastry chef and Gamini another chef that I ran into who had seen me before as well . The rooms although still lovely, were looking a bit dated. Electrical outlets with issues, and the overall feel a bit outdated. Please keep in mind this is me being overly critical, as this hotel should be at least experienced once in your life. Words cannot describe the feeling of sitting on your balcony gazing out into the scenery , with nary a sight of humanitys influence to truly experience the splendor that is Kandalama.",Positive
"We recently stayed for 2 nights & all in all it was a beautiful place to stay. However, we were originally put in room 502, directly underneath the restaurant, which resulted in chairs being dragged around above us until midnight & started up again at 5:30am. We changed rooms & had a much better night sleep the 2nd night. Rooms are lovely, albeit a little tired. The views are breathtaking & monkeys a nice novelty. Food was fantastic & staff super friendly.",Positive
"The first stop on our travels through Sri Lanka in March. Amazing views across the lake and beyond. Food was very good and the staff we found very helpful in particular the restaurant staff.A must do is a balloon ride with ""Sunrise Ballooning"", this proved to be a real pick me up following the long trip from the UK. Plenty of wildlife to see although the monkeys were bothersome on the room balcony, but this was managed and part of the charm of this hotels setting in a wilderness of outstanding beauty. Sirigiyi Rock is easily visited from here. Get there by 7am and miss the queues, climb the rock and be back for breakfast and a welcome swim.",Positive
"We have spent 2 nights at Heritance Kandalama. The hotel location is glorious!With all that beautiful nature around..breathtaking! But We didn't have much time to spend there unfortunately because we had trips to do. The breakfast was delicious with an extraordinary view. We also had dinner twice at the Kanchana bar,it was really yummi. We also had shisha that was good. The staff were really friendly. I only was uncomfortable with 1 issue:the room was not bright enough. The lights were not enough so the room was always dimmed,plus the trees outside also blocked sunlight so that's why the light in the room was too little.",Positive
"My room was spacious, modern & clean. Nice balcony overlooking the jungle. Great to have a shower with full length window looking out towards the jungle. Unfortunately we arrived after dark (on tour) so weren't 'allowed' to use the pool. A quick dinner by the pool the first night was nice, but the buffet the second night was fantastic. Lots of choices, fresh & tasty. The buffet breakfast was amazing & the view to die for !! The hotel is remote, about an hour or so from Sigiriya, but worth the drive as I found it very special.",Positive
"We arrived at the hotel at night. It's not the easiest place to find, and is sort of off the beaten path. It's also a bit of a distance from the main part of town. The entry to the hotel check-in area is not overly impressive so they escort guests back to another area where they have tables and chairs and do a check-in there. The hotel is spread out and is in the jungle near the lake. There are lots of bugs, especially at night. The view is very nice though and there is lots of flora and fauna to enjoy. You can also take a walk down to the lake if you're up for it. If not, a swim in the pool overlooking the lake is just as nice. The best thing about this hotel was the buffet breakfast. Lots of options and the tea was delicious.",Positive
"Set in an amazing natural surrounding with a breathtaking view of the lake, the hotel fits perfectly well in its natural surroundings. Staff is extremely helpful and friendly!! Rooms are spacious, the bathroom is very nice with an outside view on the trees and luxuriant vegetation. However, if you look closer to details, your enthusiasm will drop a bit: bathroom curtains have not been washed since a long while, toilet handle cleanness was a bit suspicious and some of the furniture really needed refurbishment. The buffet restaurant was rich; if you mind noisy places, choose a table outside in the garden. A la carte restaurant was excellent! Overall experience is very nice and relaxing setting is rewarding indeed!!",Positive
My expectations were perhaps a bit too high for this hotel which perhaps impacted on my impressions of my stay. We were originally given a suite on level 2 of the sigiriya wing but the view was just of bushes and trees so we were moved to level 6 of the Dambulla wing with a very nice view of the reservoir. From what I could see rooms below level 5 of both wings could have impeded views and you will be more likely to be looking at trees than sigiriya or the lake. We stayed over a very busy time with new year and Easter which I’m sure created some high demand in the restaurants. The reality was that the staff in this busy time weren’t up to the job and as others have mentioned I found the restaurant staff here to be significantly less friendly and accommodating than everywhere else in Sri Lanka. All in all it’s a nice hotel in a great area of Sri Lanka and worth considering for a 2 or 3 night stay but go in with average expectations,Positive
"There is no question that this hotel architecturally and in terms of its melding into the surrounding jungle is nothing short of stunning. The rooms overlook the neighbouring lake (Kandalama Wewa) with the balcony entwined with vines from which monkeys can often be seen. The infinity pool in terms of its design is one of the best I have seen, utilising the view out to the lake. For the amateur wildlife enthusiast there is a wealth of native animals to see including mongoose, spotted deer hornbills and monkeys. However, be warned that you are captive here when it comes to dining options with prices for drinks and food etc verging on outrageous. Breakfast options are quite good though the buffet for dinner is noisy and not my thing. The staff are also patchy when it comes to service standards. Checkin was somewhat on the impersonal side which is disappointing as being greeted with a smile does create a positive introduction. Staff at the front desk also struggle a little with English which is the one place that really matters. Perhaps it was a bad day b it they need to lift their game. Sorry to mention this, but it would also be worth management discussing personal hygiene with some of the staff at reception. Unfortunately the person who took us to the lobby with our bags was not pleasant to walk behind. The rooms do look a little tired and in need of freshening up and modernising. There is a real lack of power outlets expected in modern hotels so take a power board with you if you have phone, camera, tablets etc to charge up. The hotel is a good base for trips to Minereya, Sigarya and Polanarura.",Negative
"Very spacious hotel, room was great with monkeys walking past.. The pool areas need more lounges as it's really nice to cool off in the afternoon. stunning place to watch the sunset from the top pool, they need a bar up there… food at buffet dinner was great ,A$35 each, lot's of choices, service was excellent.Breakfast was also great ,amazing view over the lake",Positive
"We stayed two nights at the Heritance Kandalama as part of a Sri Lankan tour. It takes a bit to get to this hotel, but once you are there you'll feel like you are lost in the jungle. Half the hotel is covered in vines and out the front there are fantastic views over the reservoir and surrounding countryside. There's nothing like waking up to monkeys sitting on your outside balcony, great entertainment watching them, who needs a tv. There's a couple of beautiful pools at the hotel, so nice after a day exploring and climbing Sigiriya. The hotel is quite remote, so there's no walking to a local restaurant or shop, but you don't need to with the huge dining area and excellent buffet. We had breakfast & dinner at the hotel and at both there is just so much food and so many choices of cuisine. Plus outside there's at least 3 cooks preparing fresh dishes, like egg hoppers or omelletes for breakfast and beautiful lamb skewers for dinner. One of the best places we dined in our trip. Great food can be had anywhere though, it's the monkeys outside your window that was the hi-light for u",Positive
Stayed here for 3 fabulous nights and had wished it could have been more. Not only is the architecture ahead of its time it is in sync with it environment. Set on a man made lake with ample wildlife visiting you by the pool and your private balcony. We did bed and breakfast and would recommend this for short stay. We found the fine dinning experience better than the option of buffet. Cafe by the pool is great and has all snacks and more substantial eats as well. Staff are super friendly and accomdating and have no problems in staying again. Would definitely recommend.,Positive
"To camouflage a hotel of this size so that you barely notice it from across the lake is an immense achievement. It is most certainly not a blot on the landscape, instead being cleverly integrated into the surrounding jungle and geology. The views from the common areas of the hotel are stunning, across the lake to Sigiriya Rock and beyond. Inside, the corridors and passages are very stark, making it feel a bit like a deserted multi-storey car park. But the rooms are comfortable and well equipped. We were on the 2nd floor and looked out onto jungle. Try to get a room with a view of the lake if you can, possibly higher in the building. Most rooms have a balcony, but using it carries a warning - the local monkeys are artful, and will remove anything that takes their fancy. They will do it while you are sitting on the balcony, and their appetite isn’t just for food! The restaurant serves a diverse selection of very good food for all meals, buffet style. Or you could grab a snack from the bar on the 5th floor - both are reasonably priced. The staff are mostly friendly - one or two were a bit surly but that could be just a language issue. The majority of the service was prompt and with a smile. Although it boasts three swimming pools, there wasn’t a great deal of space to relax around the pools, and sun loungers were hard to come by. Best to avoid the pool on the 5th floor - it seems to attract all the children.",Positive
"I took a local bus from Kandy and then a local taxi to Heritance. As it was night time I saw eyes passing through a beautiful path towards the hotel. Once i got there, it was out of this world. Amazing staff from entry all the way to the room service to the breakfast hall. The views from room and from every nook and corner of this hotel is eye opening. There are monkeys around and a lot of them. Was asked to keep balcony door closed as they visit your balcony. Unknown to the fact, i watched the beautiful sunrise sat on the outside chairs and the minute i stepped back in monkeys took over. Close call. It was a beautiful experience.",Positive
"We travelled to the Heritance Kandalama in March for our honeymoon. This was one of the most scenic hotels we stayed in on our 10 day trip to Sri Lanka. The hotel has 2 wings- Sigiriya Wing and the Dambulla Wing. The Sigiriya Wing has the hotels main restaurant. We stayed in the Dambulla Wing, which we preferred- not as a fantastic view as the Sigiriya Wing, but offered more privacy. We also liked the pool on the Dambulla Wing, which was rarely used by guest. We actually saw more wildlife by the pool than guests! The room was lovely, the only downside to the room was the mattress- please replace this! It was old, tired and sagging- in dire need of an upgrade! The restaurant (buffet) was the BEST buffet we had during our trip to Sri Lanka! The service was fast and efficient. The Sri Lankan Chicken Curry, served in the area near other local food options was our most fabulous dish throughout Sri Lanka! We loved the little wildlife (Monkeys!), but be weary of them and don’t feed them- we heard stories of people being scratched or bitten by them. We loved the view of the Heritance, with the addition of the most gorgeous, romantic sunsets in the evening! We did note that we were honeymooners, however we didn’t receive any acknowledgment from the hotel. Not a drama, just something to note. 4.5*- almost 5* with the replacement of the mattress.",Positive
This hotel meets all the needs you require except for the lack of outside seating. It is a large and popular hotel with lovely views and many varieties of wild life. It would have been better if they had been somewhere to sit to appreciate all this hotel offers.,Positive
"We stayed here for 2 days after climbing the 2 nearby rocks. The hotel even though it is showing signs of aging is still a masterclass of design by Geoffrey Bawa as it makes its way along the ridge line. The staff are excellent and all to helpful together with their infectious smile. We did have an issue with our laundry and this was sorted in no time at all. The food was plentiful with the buffet sure to satisfy most tastes. The room was somewhat dated and in need of refurbishment but still held its charm with the magnificent view over the lake and the monkeys dropping by in the afternoon. The nature shower was quite effective in making you feel as if you were in the jungle. Not sure if most people take advantage or not but it is well worth your while to visit the on site paper recycling centre and eco park which includes the water treatment plant, waste recycling center, nursery,animal rehabilitation centre and herbarium. Is it worth the cost - this is a tough one - No it isn’t but there is so much to take in here as an eccoresort, if it was updated I would say yes but I wanted to see it anyway so I was happy to pay the cost.",Positive
"As a family of 3, we stayed in the one room for two nights. The room, although squashy for 3 would be a good size for a couple and there is a very large bathroom. The ambience of the room is pleasant but there is an overall tattiness. Fixtures in the bathroom in particular are discoloured and in need of replacement and lighting is not good. There is also a lack of useable power points but this seems to be common in Sri Lankan hotels. However, we enjoyed our stay. The hotel is nestled into the hillside and the windows of the rooms are curtained on the outside by jungle foliage. The view to the lake and Sigriya Rock beyond is beautiful. I cannot fault the staff, they made us feel very welcome. Because the hotel is far from alternate eateries, we partook of the buffet and were pleasantly surprised. Food there would cater to most tastes and most of it seems fresh and flavoursome, except for the desserts which inevitably look better than they taste. Breakfast was equally good with a great deal of choice. We loved watching the monkeys, some coming quite close and drinking from one of the swimming pools. We would definitely stay here again.",Positive
"A very ordinary entrance tothis hotel. But then fantastic . Express checkin. Large buffet for breakfast and lots of fruits. Great cheap laundry service and tea coffee favilities..staff is super friendly, helpfull and always available to provide information and help . Highlt recommend this hotel",Positive
"Though this hotel is a stunning piece of tropical modern architecture, be prepared - it is also a quintessential tour group hotel – ie, it is stylish and clean, but ultimately utilitarian. Still, if you want an overnight stay in Dambulla – and there is enough to warrant at least one overnight stay if not many more – you should definitely come to this hotel, if for nothing else but its glorious position and stunning buildings. However, just to be pedantic… It is as if the famous Sri Lankan architect, Geoffrey Bawa, had little regard for the practicalities and luxuries of hotel visits for there are several touches of inconveniences all around (which, in all fairness, could also be a result of its 20+ years age): the rooms are unnecessarily small, there are only two power points (one of which did not work), the lights are scant and ill-placed and the air conditioner blows directly onto sleeping bodies on the bed. Also while there are three beautiful pools they are oddly fitted – with ugly 6 x 6"" tiles and the only entry is via a small 1960s-style ladder at the far end of the infinity pool, which is divided by a rope that rather kills the infinity effect. While there is a creative rock pool (a swimming pool built around rocks which form the base and centerpiece of the pool) again it is surrounded by ugly tiles which takes away from the natural look the rocks were inspiring. Another impracticality – the bathrooms to the pools are meters away and one is not allowed to eat by the pools. While the breakfast is very elaborate and tasty, the rest of the food was below average, tasteless mass-produced hotel food. Oh, and sad to say, the seemingly adorable monkeys mean sitting on the beautiful balconies - even sans food - invites their harassment.",Negative
"Blending into the jungle, overlooking a lake. Distant hills create mad sunset photo opportunities. Terrific food. Excellent service. Easy drive to Pidurangala Rock, Sigiriya Rock Fortress, Dambulla Cave Temple etc etc. Room fixtures and fittings could do with a modest refresh, but still wonderful.",Positive
"Uniquely designed hotel right in the jungle which means wildlife is plentiful! Monkeys are regular visitors to your balcony and lizards everywhere you look! The infinity pool and dambulla wjng pools are lovely (limited sun beds so get down before 11am!) food is okay, but not 5* quality. We stayed in the sigiriya wing on the 5th floor with lovely views over the lake; you wouldn’t want to be on a floor lower than the 4th. Rooms were nice, well laid out but are let down by cleanliness. Our bins weren’t emptied, bedsheets not changed even though we left the request card out on the bed, tea/coffee not restocked. We also had a lot of tiny bug/ants all over the sink area which is the only place to get ready with a mirror. Worth staying but probably one/two nights is enough as the hotel is very isolated and is about 45 minutes drive to sigirya rock.",Negative
"Obviously the property looks tired and gloomy, yet there’s a different vibe to it, which I personally liked. Loved the view. Staff was friendly and the restaurant service was fine. Food was good and overall a good experience. Visited with family March 2019.",Positive
"This is a very good hotel, remote in terms of surrounding area but a perfect location for visiting the ""Cultural Triangle"". It is high up and overlooking the lake, very scenic. The rooms can be a fair walk away from the reception area but when I looked out of my window I overlooked foliage and trees right outside my balcony. This did cut out light but was a lovely view. The room itself was medium sized, but very clean, comfortable and with a very nice bathroom. No complaints.",Positive
Only stopped for 3 days but would have liked longer. Fantastic location and architecture and superb well trained staff. The restaurant offered super buffets with a wide variety. Great location for visiting places of historical values and well worth getting a guide. I want to thank the front office for crediting my Valentine’s Day evening meal. Most generous.,Positive
built in the middle of nature and well hidden with very nice vieuws on the lake. All the rooms have balconies but they are pretty useless as you have to keep them closed because of the monkeys. The hotel has all the infrastructure a hotel needs although a refurbishing might be a good idea. Spa and restaurant were fine but the big minus is staff. If their staff would be efficient they probably could do with half of it Here and there I saw somebody taking pleasur in their work and showing own initiative but that were the exceptions !,Positive
"That view, that thoughfullness and the pool-area... it is fantastic. We had a few drinks on the terrace-bar and enjoyed the chilled atmosphere. And realised that these features also attract the hordes of tourists, and we left quietly",Positive
"We enjoyed 4 nights at Heritance Kandalama Hotel. Friendly staff and unique beautiful surroundings. The room and bed were comfy, air con worked great, amazing view over valley with plenty of monkeys and birds to watch from the terrace. Pool area was lovely and a nice treat after a day of touring and hiking. Large and plentiful buffet breakfast with lots of good local curries, hoppers and other choices. Given the hotel’s location, there is nowhere to eat dinner but at the hotel. We didn’t do the buffet dinner as it didn’t appear special to us. Our dinner one night was at the a la carte restaurant (ok, not great). We otherwise ordered local Sri Lankan curries trough room service and honestly they were hot, plentiful, good value and very tasty. Nice in-room service with a movie!",Positive
"We stayed here for 4 nights and just loved the peaceful setting, particularly of the infinity pool overlooking the lake. To reach the hotel you travel down a long dirt track once you leave the road and the hotel is in a very rural setting. The hotel incorporates the natural rock of the area and the hotel is set into the hillside. The only real issue is that our bedroom was quite dark and the main dining room was as well, but that was the only issue. You have the wildlife of the area wandering the grounds including black face monkeys. There are also a few shops in the hotel, including stationery items where the paper is made from elephant dung,which are good value. We ate in the buffet every evening, which is changed every day so you can always find something new to eat. It caters for European and Asian tastes. The buffet was the most expensive of the hotels that we visited. You can have coffee in the lounge area, where they had some live background music. The breakfast is also buffet style and was also excellent. Located just outside of Dambulla it is an ideal location for visiting the attractions in the area. From here we went to Minneriya Park to see the elephants, then the Mihintale Temple and Anuradhapura both on the same day, Sigiryia Rock and Pidurangala Rock, Polonnaruwa and the Dambulla Cave Temple when leaving the area on the way to Kandy.",Positive
"If you are a fan of architecture then this hotel is a must. As a building and a concept it is a masterpiece. The hotel nestles into the hillside and from the other side of the lake it is hard to make out. It is festooned with vines and vegetation, birds and monkeys are as at home here as they are in the surrounding jungle. Make sure you check out the swallows nesting at the far end of the Dambulla wing at sundown. The bedrock is an integral part of the building and is skilfully incorporated to create remarkable features - walls of rock, rock rising from the floor, a swimming pool carved into the rock. Particular highlights for us, beyond the remarkable experience of staying in relative luxury but still feeling part of the natural surroundings, were dinner under the stars on the lawn outside the dining room, book this, tables are limited. The food was also exceptional, but very similar to what other Sri Lankan hotels offer on half/full board, so nothing wildly different, we never ate al a carte, only the buffet. The dining room is another highlight, amazing views across the lake and fabulous trees decorating the interior. It is a perfect base to visit Dambulla and Sigiriya, we also did an elephant safari not far away in Habarana National Park. The reason for four stars were as follows: Some of the hotel is a bit tired, it needs a bit of a make-over or freshen up in places. Our room was painfully dark, to the extent that even in the day I needed to use my phone torch to find anything in my suitcase. The vibe is slightly odd, on the first night, in a hotel of hundreds of rooms, we were the only people in the bar. We didn't really have an opportunity to talk to other people or socialise at all. The cocktails were not great! They could do with an entertainment expert coming to give them some advice on how to create a fun evening vibe - there were great spaces in the hotel that should have been buzzing with people having fun, but they just weren't. You are VERY isolated, you can't go anywhere on foot, only by car down a very long bumpy road. In some ways this is a bonus, but just don't expect to be able to go for a walk in the surrounding area. All in all an amazing experience, just needs a few tweaks to make it exceptional.",Positive
Visited the hotel 2 days back and this is the second visit. Heritance kandalama is famous for its architectural work of Geoffrey bawa. Hotel has two wings namely sigiriya and dambulla. All room have amazing views and hotel is located in a jungle and opposite the lake. Rooms are spacious and all required amneties were available. Only setback was washroom fittings are not that great as the hotel is bit old now and a refurbishment is required for certain rooms. Hotel has 3 pools. One is on the dambulla wing and other two are on sigiriya wing. You can enjoy swimming on all three but my favourite is the natural pool on the 7th floor. Staff provide excellent service and in-room dinning is great. All meals are on buffet on the main restaurant and ample variety is available. This is a must visit property for anyone visiting dambulla area. Had a great stay and definitely one more visit to this place will happen soon.,Positive
"This hotel is all about the fantastic architecture, location and wildlife. It might say sound surprising to say that the excellent food rescues the experience, but the rooms and many of the corridors are looking a bit tired and in need ‘a lick of paint’.For a top priced hotel the rooms and pool areas are not up to standard. We were very pleased to get a free room upgrade. The room’s view over the lake is magical, but the room itself was spartan and the corridor and lift up to the seventh floor reminded us of what you might experience in a multi story car park. There is not much information about where you can walk around the hotel or view the wildlife in the grounds and on the lake shore. The front desk staff did not know much, without having to do some research. They are all very polite and pleasant, but this problem is down the organisation and the hotel’s management. There are no fitness activities (the advertised yoga is not available) and no other classes of any description, which we would expect in a top hotel. It seems the boat trips have stopped, but I managed to arrange the short walk with the hotel guide to Kandalama Rock, which was excellent, but the front desk was not clued up and it was a bit of an effort to arrange.I guess few guests know about this as none we spoke to had heard about it. It all feels like a missed opportunity to make the best of a wonderful location - it could be so much better.",Positive
"Great Hotel in a Great location. love the fact that it's surrounded by wild life. been in this hotel 4 times with family and my wife's favorite hotel from them all. love the feeling when you wake up in the morning to birds singing and all other animals moving from one branch to another. rooms has a classic architecture and seems they're planning to keep it that way for many more years to come. nice generous spread of buffet at Breakfast and Dinner. Food quality is very well maintained as well. rooms are nice and clean with a balcony. staffs are very friendly and helpful. you do get outdoor activities where the hotel can organize for you during your stay. but all I ever use is the Elephant ride through the jungle and across the lake plus the village tour. when it comes to the village tour, make sure to do a lot of research in choosing the correct organizer as you might get over charged. but the Hotel can help you on this as well. has two main pools where one is in fact an Infinity pool that over seas the Forrest.. Breath taking!!! i would be there until my legs are numb. you may get surrounded by monkeys who would want to get to the pool to have a drink. but don't worry as they're harmless. they still use the old metal keys with a gigantic tag to open the guest room door and the Internet is very bad. for one's who wants to get away from the noisy concrete city, phone calls or noisy roads and to be surrounded by wildlife and forests and to spend a quite, quality time by the pool or the balcony of your room and to mediate in whichever way that you want or to read your favorite book; this is the best place for you. I would return to this place over and over again.",Positive
This hotel is perched on the shore of a reservoir. An infinity pool with a reservoir view is just outside reception. The rooms are nice with wood furniture and walls. My bathroom was a good size with an excellent shower plus a bathtub. (Complaint: the shower lip is too high making it easy to hurt your toes). The breakfast buffet was good. The dinner buffet had both Sri Lankan and western dishes. Anyone could find plenty to eat. There are monkeys outside. Keep your window closed.,Positive
Staying here for 5 nights. Beautiful designed piece of architecture that must have been jaw dropping when first opened. The vines now grow over the hotel and monkeys on your balcony and everywhere become the norm. Rooms are comfortable with high quality linens and toiletries and the staff are thoughtful and attentive with nothing being too much trouble. The food is excellent and the chefs need to be commended on excellent food morning noon and night .... my only criticism is that the hotel needs some updating ...toilets looks a little old in the bathroom ...however the staff and amenities make this forgivable . A great spa that I used on many occasions and beautiful infinity pool where you must make the effort to make that shot. Good accommodation for drivers too which is a must. I shall be sad to leave this hotel in the next few days and will certainly recommend the experience to other travellers. Again the staff need to be highly commended for their kindness welcome and attitude.,Positive
"Our previous visit was 12 years ago when we stayed for our honeymoon. Therefore we thought we’ll try again. Also looking for recommendations for our British friends. After the Sigirya climb we thought of relaxing at Kandalama. We had such wonderful memories. However sad to say the hotel needs updating and it just not the same. The training staff at the reception said how unhappy they were with long working hours and stuck in the jungle. The room’s drapes needs washing and hotel just look dated. The breakfast was wonderful. The staff at the breakfast restaurant were very helpful. Panchalie was just one of those people that put a smile to your face. She took our little girl to show a beehive and rice field. Thank you for making our stay a special one. The dinner near the infinity pool was terrible we waited for ages and in-spite of making it clear that we want all food together... we received the bowl of chips after 1 hour. The pot of tea was served in between meals. Just very badly run. We had to ask about 5 times when we can expect our food. We just wanted a snack so ordered pizzas, bowel of chips, pot of tea and water. Anyway not even word of apology by the staff at the pool bar/restaurant. This would be our last visit this hotel. Also the valet parking scraped our hired car and didn’t even tell us. There are many lovely new hotels to try out next time we visit Sri Lanka. Sadly for the money you pay it’s not worth it.",Negative
"We were not let down by the architecture of this famous Bawa hotel. However, some of the internal spaces were not right. Pokey soulless bar & dreary outdoor furniture in casual outdoor area near infinity pool.Rooms fine with fabulous view across to lake. As others have written about fittings & fixtures showing signs of wear. Bed & pillows fine. Enough room to put things away in room & bathroom. Bathroom not that well lit at night. Infinity pool nice for lazing & monkey watching. Spa good $60 US for 60 minute facial French products and quite good technique used. Food for breakfast buffet very good. It was our mistake not to dine at buffet for evening meal. Restaurant on 7th floor a la carte but 3 nights of dining gave limited options, food menus & cooking techniques of some European food need review. Cocktails not always as they should be eg lumps of ice in a margarita?? Close to Golden Buddha Temple & Lion Rock so a good option for this area. Very good bird life for bird watching. Be at Lion Rock at 7am to avoid crowds & heat. Staff try very hard & are willing to please.",Positive
"I stayed at tghe Heritance Kandalama Hotel for three nights during a trip of Sri Lanka. The hotel is in a very nice location surrounded by the forest. There is a lot of visible concrete in the structure and this does sometimes give a feeling of oppression and darkness. This impression is stronger in the adiacent building. Common areas in the main building are nice. The rastaurant is very good, with a varied buffet of both western and local food. The dinner for New Year's Eve was absolutely gorgeous, very stylish and elegant. Our room was in a separate building, to be reached via a long open corridor. While the room was pleasant and had all amenities, it had not been renovated for years and it showed age in many aspects.",Positive
Stunning Geoffrey Bawa designed hotel set amongst the rainforest and the ideal location from which to explore Sigiriya and cultural triangle. Great room with deck and view of lake. Spa was lovely and the yoga and pool. Only downside I would suggest they could improve on a bit is the food. It’s good-ish but could be better,Positive
"Our travel company Trailfinders booked us in at Heritance Kandalama for 3 nights on the second stop of our 15 day Honeymoon in Sri Lanka. The hotel is cleverly designed to blend into the scenery in the jungle, and from a distance you struggle to see it. As we were a Honeymoon couple, we were upgraded on arrival and received a lovely room with a lake view and a jacuzzi bath with a rain shower (the best shower I have experienced). Also as a bonus we received a decorated bed and chocolates. As the hotel is in the jungle, expect to see wildlife. The corridors in the hotel are out in the open, so expect to see see bugs in the walkway. Don't let that put you off though, its all part of the experience! Not to mention the monkeys on the balcony.This hotel is well located for the cultural triangle (if you have a driver), we visited a traditional Si Lankan village near Habarana, Sigiriyi Rock, Ritagala Nature Reserve and Polonnaruwa.The hotel has a couple pools. I tried out the infinity pool overlooking the lake. It also has a couple of nice restaurants. There is a buffet type restaurant in which you pay a fixed price and eat as much as you want, they seem to do a theme each night we was there as well as your traditional Sri Lankan food. The alterative restaurant is the a la carte restaurant on the top floor. This was abit more classy than the buffet restaurant and personally I preferred this. There wasn't really a massive difference in price between the restaurants either. After dinner there is a nice lounge area where you can order drinks and chillout with live music, or a different bar on the floor below. The staff at this hotel were top class, very friendly and hospitable as with most hotels in Sri Lanka. They honestly can't do enough to make you feel welcome. We absolutely loved this hotel, would recommend to anyone wanting to stay near the cutural triangle",Positive
"Pros - amazing jungle setting, views and wildlife. Our room, (delux king), was great - fab views over jungle from the showe/ bath. Lovely smiley staff. Close to Siguriya. Great breakfast buffet.

Cons - public spaces are large and impersonal - they really lack atmosphere. Only one small bar area which seems focused on advertising and feels like a sports bar. Nature walks need better guides - who speak English and can really tell you about what you see. A missed opportunity for the hotel. One night would have been enough here. They could screen films, offer cooking lessons, offer guided lake activities and have a nice cocktail bar - great potential but needs more thought.",Positive
"Very integrated architecture in a beautiful landscape, comfortable room with incredible view. Beautiful nature including the visit of monkeys on your balcony. Excellent breakfast buffet, lunch and dinner average. What was different from all the places we went to during our trip is the generic service and approach from the staff, large hotel a bit impersonal.",Positive
"We had a good time ,food spread was great and the staff were very polite and alert..ambience is excellent with nothing around but nature and animals..only thing the rooms need upgrade..it was clean but old .",Positive
Had a wonderful time with family the food was good rooms were good but needs updating very good spot to travel round dabula went on a balooning trip and eliphent safary.visit local places like Sigeriya minneriya safary park bird santuary,Positive
"The large hotel is built on a foresty hill, by a lake, and part of the granite rock of the hill is somehow included in its architecture. The hotel is very secluded in the forest, surrounded by trees inhabited by curious monkeys and our balcony door (offering a beautiful view of the lake) had a sticker advising that the door should not be left open because of them. The hotel has an infinity pool, the dining area offered great views of the lake and the breakfast buffet had a good variety of local and western dishes. Our room was smallish and could have been cleaner, there were some small insects in the bathroom which had no tub but just a standing shower. Strangely, there no slippers available and from the shower you had to get back to the room barefooted. The hotel is about quarter of century old and it could use some good maintenance work, a fresh layer of paint and some upgraded accessories. We too found the staff to be less than polite and helpful and a substantial better training might improve the quality of what otherwise could have been an amazing experience.",Positive
A Good Hotel. It is cut out from a mountain. It is located near the lake so the view of the lake from the Hotel was Amazing. A bit far from Dambulla town. Fewer Options for Vegetarians. Staff is very courteous and friendly,Positive
"Loved the setting and timeless architecture of Geoffrey Bawa along with comfortable rooms and excellent service.
This is a great location for visiting Sigiriya and Dambullah.and the staff are friendly and helpful.
Highly recommended all round.",Positive
This hotel's location is amazing... we woke up in the morning and saw monkeys on our balcony... the staff and food are great... service is very good... the rooms are clean but at night alot of insects tend to come inside as the hotel in right in the middle of the jungle; if you don't mind these creepers then the overall experience would be very nice.,Positive
"An amazing hotel. The staff and architecture of the heritance kandalama set it apart from all others. Everyone we encountered ensure your stay with them is truly memorable. We couldn't fault the food offerings (given its location you don't really have any alternative) and it was very reasonably priced. Our one observation is the hotel is 25 years old and some areas including the rooms need an upgrade as they are showing their age. The upstairs pool was stunning, but to get to it you went via an unused function room and across a partially grassed muddy stepping stone pathway. And despite being told towels would be available you actually need to get them from the main pool. It seemed a very forgotten area. The bathroom really needed a renovation. Ours had a rusty old bin in the room and all the taps and toilets were well oast their use by date. The spa looks fantastic but in reality is dangerous to get in and out of. Anyone unsteady on their feet would struggle with the big step over and into the bath. Overall a memorable hotel, but done work on the room is needed",Positive
"Wonderful designed hotel work brilliantly well with its surrounding. Lots of wildlife surrounding the hotel. along with the jungles monkey's you can find eagles flying over head Elephants and snakes roaming. Spent 6 nights here for our Honeymoon Early Oct. the only issue we had that private dinning wasn't that private. We had paid £300 to hire the cave and have a 7 course dinner. We had 4 male tourist from central asia come in tthe cave and take photos of us and the cave itself , while walking past our private butler.",Positive
"Wonderful.scenery and wildlife so close to hotel. Staff friendly and hard working to keep the hotel immaculate. Food was amazing a truly wonderful experience that we would recommend. The spa was really fabulous, the infinity pool was so relaxing even when the monkeys jumped in. A central point for exploring this area of Sri lanka. A fair distance from the airport but still with the drive. Evidence of Elephants within the grounds, but didn't see first hand.",Positive
Blend with Kandalama lake and forest together with the view of Famous Sigiriya Rock fort and Pidurangala Buddhist monastery the hotel has a breathtaking scenery. At one point you can have the luxury of a view of 180 degrees from Dambulla Golden Cave temple to Sigiriya. Food was delicious and arranged with a tase of art. However this is a aged hotel and some modern amenities are not available. Better prepared for a multi socket charger because it will be helpful. You have to take long walk to the cafeteria so don’t afraid to eat handsomely because you’ll burn lots of calories when you’re back in the room 😜,Positive
"We went here for our first two nights on arrival at Columbo airport. It is a very convenient drive (about 3 hours), and in a lovely setting with great views. Ultimately it was our least favorite hotel in Sri Lanka, but we stayed in what are all top ten hotels, so know this was of a high standard. Ultimately it was a bit noisy and crowded near the pool area, and the dinner buffet was simply unremarkable, and our rooms were on the lower floors so a bit disappointing with lots of insect activity. Check in was very slow and while we were given some nice juice while waiting, it really shouldnt have taken so long to check us in. Prices are not cheap, we booked direct, but ultimately this hotel seems to favor its tour group the most. We'd recommend this for this area of the island, but there are better choices within 3 hours of the airport, such as the Jetwing Lagoon, but this place is very convenient for the cultural triangle, and we'd highly recommend it as the base for that.",Positive
"We stayed for 2 nights at the Heritance Kandalama at the start of our week in Sri Lanka, the hotel was designed by the famous architect Geoffrey Bawa, and it is built into the rain forest, the wildlife that can be found in the surrounding area is incredible! The hotel is clean, but I have to say arriving at night in the evening of our first day was a bit of a shock, this hotel takes some getting used to as there are bugs all around you constantly and don’t be surprised to be sharing your room with a gecko or two at all times. They can be quite noisey at night and disturbed our sleep. This hotel really is spending a night in the jungle and you will hear lots of noises through the stay which can be a bit nerve racking at night, including monkeys running up and down the corridor and sitting on your balcony (they tend to leave you alone if you leave them alone). Despite the initial shock it’s an incredible experience. Food is ok, standard buffet for breakfast and evening meal... facilities are good, the infinity pool overlooks a large lake where you can see animals drinking. You will see elephants snakes and lizards on the grounds if you are lucky too. Plenty of sightseeing to be had nearby.",Positive
"his is quite a large hotel, and very impressive. We were looking forward to visiting this hotel as it is definately something different, and we werent disappointed. The view from our room was stunning, watching the monkeys in the trees outside and playing on our balacony was one of the highlights of our trip to Sri Lanka. The service at this hotel is excellent as is the food. We had a corner room and so had double aspect windows which was wonderful. The only fault I have to make was seeing the elephant that is used by the hotel for people to ride tethered and wearing chains around its neck. Very upseting to see and not the reason we visited this beautiful country. Surely seeing these magnificent creatures in the wild is far better than seeing this animal chained and tethered and used for pleasure ride",Positive
"We stayed four nights here as a base for exploring the cultural triangle and it was an amazing experience. We were lucky to get an upgrade to a mini suite with great views and well away from the central area. Staff service was superb and the buffets had a fantastice choice of Asian and European food. However we found that the service, whilst excellent, was rather impersonal which we put down to its being a big hotel with constantly changing guests. We were there in the quiet season and we suspect that in the peak season it could be a problem to find space around the pools. After dinner they offer free tea and music in the lounge but it is not well advertised and we were often alone listening to some great musicians.",Positive
"Where to start...! Built in the mountains, overlooking the lake and jungle, our room was just simply stunning, with incredible views (even from the shower!). All the food we had was cooked perfectly with good taste and lots of choice, especially for buffet breakfast. Room service was punctual and the staff friendly and helpful. As with all luxury 5*s they know how to charge for food and drivers, but in comparison to some other currencies, still value for money. The big issue for us was noise. During the week it was no problem... hotel was all adults (many honeymooners), but come the weekend, children were running round everywhere (breakfast, etc). Our superior room was on the third floor one flight up from the pool but by the stairs where you entered it from (room 340). We had over excited kids running up and down past our door for a good hour (not what you want at 7am on vacation!) and then they proceeded to play music (we had to complain) and make noise playing in the pool. Not the kids fault, they were having a good time, but impossible to relax before a long haul flight as rooms are not soundproofed (doors or windows). We could also hear floors being cleaned, early morning, etc. Overall this place is incredible and definitely worth a visit - it is genuinely breathtaking. Our room was worth every penny, just not at the weekend! Ask for a room away from the pool or book day excursions so you’re out and you should be fine.",Positive
"We had a lovely time at Heritance Kandalama and were lucky enough to receive an upgrade - it is an amazing location and food was delicious. Safe to assume with all 5star hotels beware of high prices for food, drinks, laundry and drivers. Our only issue was minor communication problems, we arrived and were seated at a cafe, no one gave any indication that we could check in other than scanning our passports. About 30min later someone came with a piece of paper to sign, then said our room wasn’t ready yet. We decided to have something to eat, when it was time to sign the bill they were very confused that we didn’t know our room number and spent another 15minutes trying to figure if we had checked in. After an hour and a half we were taken to our room, thankfully with an apology. Minor communication issues were throughout but our guess was it due to many staff at site (calling multiple times about one thing, even after we had given an answer). Would still recommend visiting such a beautiful hotel.",Positive
"High quality resort with beautiful lake and jungle views. Rooms were spacious, quiet and clean. All our meals were well prepared and tasty. Good cocktail and wine selections. The buffets were incredible. So many options and great quality. The infinity pool overlooked the lake and was a great place to unwind. Only annoyance we had was not enough lounges by the pool so we had to sit in the cafe and walk down each time we wanted a swim. They had lots of dead space around it, which just looked untidy. Shame they don't utilise it with more lounges and umbrellas. Highly recommend a walk around the lake. Felt like we were in Madagascar.",Positive
"Staying for 3 nights as a base for the ancient capitals and Buddhist shrines. The hotel is a little tired, but clean and well looked after. Staff are excellent and food has been very good. The hotel is quite unique in terms of its green credentials. Great views from our room. We would recommend.",Positive
Lives up to its name as an one of Asia's award winning Eco hotels. Enjoyed our stay. A special mention of Raj for his excellent service in resaverations. The hotel Was somewhat crowdeded with chanisees and Korean tourist who i felt was a bit loude at times.,Positive
"This hotel designed by Bawa is an amazing construction built into the rocks and hill and has great views. The horizon edge pool is quite special. It is a big hotel with constant movement of large groups in and out so does feel a little impersonal but the service was good and food, especially the breakfast, very impressive.",Positive
"As a family, we stayed 3 nights in Heritance Kandalama... I admired the roof gardens and well as the pool on the roof..At night when walking to the restaurant we could see bats flying in the corridors…There were also monkeys visiting outside the restaurant and on the ways between the buildings...The buffet was varied including local food, Asian and western food... there even was a fresh juice station!!!There were.beautiful views on the artificial lake..The rooms were decorated with taste and soundproof.Last, the coco spa was a place you should definitely visit: it was heaven on earth.. the staff was skillful and very accommodating; we wanted to go back on our last day but they were already fully booked, yet they took us after hours for a 1hr massage... so grateful, thank you!",Positive
"After staying in an airbnb in another part of Sri Lanka, this mega hotel felt a bit soulless and impersonal at first. The staff at check-in were polite but there wasn't that personal, sincere touch that we had gotten used to in Sri Lanka.We booked a Superior room, which is the most basic room, and our room was on the lowest level. This hotel is built into the surface of rock structures, so the lower levels felt a little dank and humid. But once we stepped into our room, it really felt like a sanctuary. The room was clean and pretty well sealed from the outside environment. This is important as this hotel has tons of night flies, lizards, and praying mantis at night. But only on the outside of the rooms, never in the room itself. After the first night shock of walking among swarms of flies on the walls, we got used to it and were never really bothered by it after that. It IS a jungle hotel after all.We loved our room, we loved the pool (go to the Rashmi pool at the second level, it is MUCH less crowded than the main pool), and we loved loved the buffet breakfasts and dinners. This hotel is secluded so the quality and value of the restaurant is so important. We liked the variety of the buffet dinner, and the fact that the breads were baked fresh / warmed in the dining hall itself. To summarise, we enjoyed our stay here- loved walking around the hotel to take in the views and breeze. In fact, we kinda regret going to Polonnaruwa on our last day- would've enjoyed spending an entire day just lazing in this hotel instead.",Positive
"This is a truly unique and different hotel, unlike any I have ever stayed in before. This is due to it being built into the side of a mountain and covered from top to toe in jungle vines. The hotel stretches for 1km from end to end which is another unique thing about it. Although it is huge, it doesn't quite feel that way. The hotel staff are wonderful from reception to dining staff to pool staff to cleaning staff to bell boys... they are all so friendly. The hotel is built in the hillside, which looks spectacular. It is overgrown by vines from top to bottom and it is crawling with monkeys. They come sit on your balcony and you don't dare leave your balcony door open... they are straight inside. We had a beautiful suite on the 3rd floor with a huge glass windowed shower looking out over the jungle. I also relaxed in the spa bath sipping a wine looking out at the gorgeous view... it was amazing. We had a huge living area with balconies off both there and the bedroom. It was just stunning. The food is absolutely amazing. Our buffet breakfast selections were incredible and we also had dinner here twice. The chefs are always there cooking for you. The hotel has three different pools and we used all three.The playful monkeys come and hang around the pools to play. They are quite entertaining. We went out to all the surrounding tourist sights in the mornings and returned to the pool in the afternoons. There are so many things to see nearby such as Lion Rock, Pidurangala Temple Cave Rock and the Dambula Temple Caves. It was quite expensive to stay but worth every cent as the experience was so unique. This really is a must stay hotel in Sri Lanka.",Positive
The hotel is uniquely situated in the middle of the jungle . So you see monkeys dears peacocks etc . You can go walking to a very near lake where u can see an elephant bathing and see rabbits running . The hotel itself looks better in photos than reality . Rooms are old . The meals at hotel are very expensive . Even the sauna and steam which are offered as complimentary to hotel guests all over the world you are asked to pay for it . The staff is very friendly in general however sometimes you don't really understand what they are saying because of the very heavy accent in English . IN any hotel in the world you will find some free activities that will encourage clients to join and then pay for some other activities in this hotel everything you have to pay for it and very expensive,Negative
"We stayed here for two nights mid-August. We were seated outside near the pool area whilst being checked in (which took 15 minutes) and were given a drink and a fresh cloth to freshen up. We were taken to our room on the 4th floor and the view over the lake with Sigiriya in the background was stunning! The room was lovely and clean and there were some nice touches, like the handmade cookies and cashew nuts. The food in the buffet restaurant was pretty nice, although not amazing like other buffet restaurants we had experienced. The staff were friendly but not too attentive as it was a busy hotel and they had to check on quite a few guests. A carafe of red wine was almost 4000 rupees which we thought was too expensive. The monkeys surrounding the hotel are cute and adorable! Overall an enjoyable and pleasant stay, just mealtimes could be improved. The views are breathtaking",Positive
"We used this hotel as our base to explore the region - we visited Polonnaruwa, Sigiriya Lion Rock, Dambulla cave temples and Kaudulla NP from here. Convenient, but a base in Sigiriya would be better as the drives would be shorter. However, given the unique setting of this hotel, I think it’s worth the extra travel time. The hotel has a stunning location, and the architect did an extraordinary job to settle such a large building amongst the nature and the rock. Wonderful views everywhere with the building hiding behind the jungle growth. Nature here is accepted and not fought against, with open corridors, so the monkeys, lizards and insects are free to roam, and they do! Fantastic. We stayed here for three nights. Spacious suite. The living room, bedroom and bathroom, including shower, all with magnificent views over the lake. Breakfast was reasonable, with a live cooking station which was good. Room service, and the a la Carre menu in the pool area were all good. We didn’t try the a la Carre restaurant. We had the buffet one evening which also includes a live cooking station. Whilst the food is plentiful, we didn’t enjoy it (poor quality meat for example and lacking flavours). Would we stay longer? - yes because of the peaceful and special setting, but no because of the food.",Positive
"A fantastic hotel with 3 swimming pools, dramatic views, lovely rooms and a nice (if a little limited) games room. Our 3 night stay was slightly marred by some poor staff. The lady who greeted us was thorough but really insincere in her greeting and some of the other staff were a bit officious. A great shame as most of the staff were really great.",Positive
"The hotel is surrounded by lush green vegetation and a lake. Rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. Breakfast is fantastic. A lot of monkeys around the property, so keep the door (patio door) closed. They will ransack your room if left open. The bar closed early even though they said it would be open till midnight.",Positive
"It was a greatt experience , our room was near the monkeys and all kind of trees so it was so entertaining. The infinity pool is wonderful with its stunning view! The buffet was very rich and diverse , the food was great. The service was great and especially the room service who surprised us each time we entered our room because it was our honeymoon! In our third night we enjoyed listening to a live sri lanka band in the lounge! New experience and unforgettable!",Positive
"We recently had three nights here while touring Sri Lanka. First impressions are good with a welcoming drink in the cafe by the infinity pool. Evening meal buffet was good as were the breakfasts. We also had some snacks and drinks in the cafe which were good too. Decor in the rooms a little tired and could do with updates to bathroom, furniture and lighting. Noise from other rooms and the walkways outside the room was disturbing at night soundproofing could definitely be improved.",Positive
"We stayed here for four nights but were really quite disappointed. Our first room smelt of damp and the plug was broken where the mosquito lamp should be plugged in. We had to be moved to another room which meant packing and moving again. The bathrooms were outdated with such high bath tubs which were jacuzzis so it was very difficult to get in and out. The infinity pool was madness at the weekend and had ver few sun beds so you had to be very lucky to sit by the pool. The hotel needs updating and relies on being in the most wonderful location. Food was good and service was fine, we felt it just didn’t live up to its reputation.",Negative
"Not only worth a trip for architecture-aficionados, but also for backpackers who want to relax a few days. Being built into the rock and looking over the Kandalama Reservoir, the Heritance offers a great mix of nature and a bit of luxury, even tough it’s a huge complex. Get one of the better rooms to enjoy a great view, especially from the bathroom. Their buffet restaurant has a big selection of western food as well, but if you’re into the local curries, go to the a la carte restaurant where you get a great selection of them for the same price and less people.",Positive
"Wonderful place - the garden of Eden? I recommend yoga in Kandelama - took A class this morning - revitalized, rise and shine🙏 As a foreign yogi it was easy to follow the guided session. Kandalama is the place to be when you love Nature. A scenic place for body, mind and soul👌",Positive
"Up graded our room to Sigiriya wing with an extra payment. Superb view of Sigiriya and Pidurangala at the far end. Jungle full of natural sounds such as rustling forest trees and birds chirping, Fantastic !! Spacious and comfortable room comes with a Jaqucci and an overhead shower. Delicious food. Good spread of desserts. Breakfast buffet was the highlight among the lunch and dinner buffets . But not their “Roast Paan”. Too hard to bite. Friendly and attentive staff and Akila – life guard at infinity pool on the top of the list. Not forgetting Shamalie – Pastry chef at the cafe bar who served us professionally with an innocent smile. There are two more swimming pools and Rashmi – the largest pool is good for an evening swim. Second time in Kandalama and had a wonderful two day stay in a peaceful nature environment . Would love to go back. Highly recommend to all who needs a holiday with nature.",Positive
"This hotel which is like 100 yrs old is maintained well and cleanliness is on top! Rooms are good and there are lots of monkeys and other birds revolving arnd the hotel.. best part was their swimming pool with the bestest view possibly one can imagine! Food, drinks, people, stay, etc everything was memorable for us..!",Positive
"We treated ourselves to one night at this amazing hotel and am so glad we did. The views from our room (and the bathtub) were just amazing and waking up in the morning to see monkeys playing in the trees outside your window was just incredible. The infinity pool has views to Sigiriya and if you’re having lunch at the cafe near the pool you might be lucky enough to see the resident chipmunk. The hotel is perfectly located for day trips to Sigiriya and the Miineriya National Park and if you’re looking to spoil yourself, I would definitely recommend it.",Positive
Heritance Kandalama is one of the best 5 star hotels in Dambulla. There is approximately a 30/45 minute drive to both Sigiriya and Pidurangala which are main attractions in Dambulla. The hotel arrange transportation for you if you don't have means to commute. The hotel is at the edge of the kandalama river with a breath taking view. This is an eco friendly hotel and the corridors are open where you get to see monkeys frequently. I got to know that the hotel has a bird's park and some animals even though I didn't get a chance to visit. The food was good (specially the local cuisine) with a satisfying variety. However we were told that they are not laying out the buffet for one meal as they didn't have enough guests and we were offered the option of going with a local meal or ala carte. Eventhough we've paid for full board we were informed that we need to pay if we are to order from ala carte which was unfair. Apart from that glitch the stay was enjoyable and relaxing with a pleasant staff.,Positive
"We stayed here for three nights on our way to the east coast. It was our third visit. Geoffrey Bawa's innovative design of 1995 is probably his masterpiece. Not everyone will like the minimalist design but its setting and deference to the landscape are awe inspiring. The enormous bronze owl by artist Laki Senanayaka dominating the staircase is amazing. As we had visited all the ancient sites in the cultural triangle on previous visits, we spent a long time just sitting on our balcony, looking at the dream view and spotting birds - although the two resident troops of monkeys who patrol the area can be a pain. A walk in the grounds also rewarded us with sightings of a giant squirrel, lizards, a mongoose and beautiful butterflies. The infinity pool is stunning. We visited Mineriya National Park which is part of the 'elephant corridor' and had excellent sightings of elephant herds and many birds. I would say, after three visits, that the hotel is slightly showing its age and could probably do with some updating of the bathrooms particularly. We stayed in the Sigirya wing and we had a huge bath/jacuzzi with overhead rain shower but the bath was extremely difficult to access with a step. As I'm short, I needed my husband's help to get in and out. A separate walk-in shower would be preferable. We had also forgotten from previous visits that you can hear noise from the restaurant if you are underneath it on the 4th and 5th floors of the Sigirya Wing. We asked for a room change on our second day and they were able to accommodate us. The restaurant was as good as ever with buffet options and fresh outside cooking stations. We felt privileged to stay here again.",Positive
"I last visited Kandalama in 2011 and it was great to be back and find the hotel as charming as before. The room we stayed in (Superior Twin, Sigiriya Wing) was on point, the buffet spreads at dinner and breakfast were generous and I only wish we stayed more than one night.",Positive
"This hotel is much larger than the ones we usually choose, but was well placed for our chosen activities. We stayed for three nights. Our room was very well appointed, with views over the jungle and the lake. We were able to watch the monkeys playing on our balcony from the bedroom and from the bath! The buffet in the main restaurant was perfectly adequate and the tables were cleared quickly and efficiently. However, the food in the a la carte restaurant was excellent, with impeccable service. We wished we'd eaten there on each of our three nights.",Positive
"This was the second time I have stayed at the Heritance Kandalama and the fifth time I have visited Sri Lanka. This hotel was the first to be LEED certified outside of the States and the first in Asia to be Green Globe certified, but after 25 years, it is looking a little tired around the edges. That said, it's a great property, offering good views and a great vantage point, overlooking the reservoir and Sigiriya in the far distance. Because it is effectively draped all over with vines, it's hard to spot from a distance. The hotel embraces the local wildlife - birds of prey dot the skies, a lot of smaller native birds inhabit the forest at the edges of the property and at any time your balcony can be invaded by a troupe of curious macaques (keep the room doors closed!). I found the service to be fine, the room (sitting and bedroom) very spacious, the fixtures a little worn - but, it is the tropics. Everything wears very quickly in this climate. The food, especially at breakfast, is good, especially if you love Sri Lankan food, as we do. I organised for my small group to attend a cooking demonstration - in fact we had a tour of the kitchens, sampled a lot of foods, and met the head chef, originally Sri Lankan but now living in Canberra. The demo was great (crab curry), as was food afterwards - we had the entire dining room to ourselves. Organise this through the PR manager onsite.",Positive
"so i decided to re-do my review here since my last review since the staff totally stepped up. i was touched by their efforts to make up for the first day that didnt go too well. so in all fairness i decided to write my review. on the first day i was dissapointed by the speed of work and ability to understand needs by the staff but on the second day after my review they really gave 100% and i'm thankful for that. the hotel though is really not 5* at all. its 3* leaning on a 4* . the entrance for starters didnt look like a hotel lobby reception with any form of grandeur. The heritance negombo for example had a much better standard. The second floor in which i stayed on has a shocking scene when the lift opens,... it feels like an underground dirty dungeon with a huge wasp or some bug nest 10m in front of the lift. The place looks dirty and bug ridden , which i can understand must be hard for the hotel to manage cos its in the jungle like area. at night u need to run to yr room ans shut the door asap or the bugs come in. they hv a nice pool and its nice to see monkeys and squirrels coming over. food was not worth the money. it was an international buffet which seemed strange cos in sri lanka u'd want sri lankan food not risotto. too much meat and not enough vegetarain food. was dissapointed with the dinner..... but breakfast was not too bad. staff at the restaurent were hardworking and kind",Negative
"The hotel’s location and views are amazing. We were kindly upgraded to a nicer room with jacuzzi tub and balcony. The staff were always friendly and welcoming and the food was really delicious. There are some improvements that can be made in regards to room cleanliness, some of it is quite dated and therefore mouldy/dirty. There are a lot of bugs/insects around the hotel at night time but it is set in the jungle so is to be expected. Overall we had a really great stay.",Positive
"During our visit to kandalama we were stayed at a triple room, considering about the size its comparatively small but it was fully equipped and completed with amenities. They have got a classic infinity pool facing to kandalama reservoir, which gives mind relaxing view during the sunset. Staff is well trained and love their morning buffet as well as dinner. Recommended place for who are seeking geoffrey bawa's architecture meets natural beauty.",Positive
"Our room was located on the fifth floor facing the lake. The view was magnificant. I wish I had one more day so I could enjoy the hotel more.Therre are 3 pools where you can enjoy and relax at the same time, and infinity pool is the winner with the view toward the Sigiryia. The room was spatious with nice bathroom, though it is visible that it needs to be restaurated. The bed was very cosy and the pillows as well. The buffet breakfast and lunch is for everyone's taste. And stuff is very friendly and courteous. I slept like a baby, and that was really needed. I plan to go again this year, as I told almost all my friend about this hotel. I wish that the prices are not that high...",Positive
"I enjoyed our two night stay here. The rooms were almost minimalist and the bathrooms offered views, as did the bedroom, through tropical vines to the ""jungle"" below and the hills in the distance and each morning we were greeted by families of monkeys grooming each other or trying to control their wee ones on the balcony. so best obey the advice to keep balcony doors closed as the wee devils get everywhere. The public rooms we re less than useful and the bar usually empty. Corridors were open with the rocks and trees encroaching on them. Breakfast, like dinner, was buffet style and reasonable in choice and variety and some cook-to-order but generally very busy.",Positive
"Had a lovely stay here and there are plenty of things to recommend about it including the location, the set up and the friendly staff. It is let down by quite average rooms and food that is just alright and mainly westernised",Positive
"Worth a visit for the setting and architecture as well as the fixtures and fittings detail of course, but the big surprise here was the yoga. As a yoga teacher I struggle to find classes I like whilst travelling so was very happy to spend an excellent 2 hour class with Lanka that included Pranayama, Sukshma Vyayam a nice sun flow and Yoga Nidra. There are also ancient meditation spots nearby that apparently Lanka leads groups to. The yoga is $20/hour. The food and service at the hotel are not good, but the design, infinity pool and yoga made it well worth the stay.",Positive
"With its jungle setting and architectural design everything just blends into the landscape. This is a great hotel to use as a base to discover Sigiriya, Polonnaruwa and Dambulla. I would recommend a deluxe rooms with lakeviews and lion rock. In the morning you can watch the monkeys playing in the tree tops. For a big hotel the service and food was excellent. This is an extremely comfortable hotel for a two night stay.",Positive
"Stopped over for the lunch and scenic view, and was well satisfied!! The buffet offers delicious Sri Lankan curries, as well as an array of Western food options, seafood BBQ, desserts, fruits and drinks. The building architecture is a true work of art, and don't forget to see the monkeys chilling in the grounds.",Positive
"Arrived after a long journey from the coast in the dark. Escorted to my room quickly and efficiently. The room clean, tidy a kind of colonial feel with dark wood and ceiling fan (there is Air Con). Quite liked the jacuzzi tub in the window of the bathroom. It would take the rising of the sun the following day to highlight how impressive the view was...which was pretty impressive. We took dinner in the main restaurant with the hotel buffet. Lots of choice, not amazing quality but perfectly ok. Breakfast choice was fine the following morning with live stations catering to different ethnic tastes. I found the bar area a bit limited and the public areas a little too dark in the evening. If you are thinking of staying here, Google external images of the hotel and you will see why it is unique. This is quite a special hotel... including the monkey’s outside the bedrooms looking in to see what food and anything else they can steal... The light and power controls behind the headboard were a little odd and difficult to operate in low light - I had to resort to using the torch on my phone to see. Hotel has several different pools and an upmarket a la carte restaurant. This is all about location....it is about 30 mins from Sirigiya, which can be seen from the one wing of rooms. Return... yup!",Positive
"A beautiful place blending perfectly into the surrounding jungle. Great staff which makes you very welcome, delicious food and nice rooms. We liked to lush vegetation around and monkeys, squirrels, bats and birds coming to visit. Yet the prices for food, beverage and Spa for example are even for European standards quite pricey. Therefore one star deducted.",Positive
"This is a hotel that promises much from the reviews and photos... perhaps too much. It is certainly nice, and would have been a very innovative design a few decades ago. The views from our room were superb, and you definitely feel right in the jungle with wildlife right outside. The fixtures and fittings are starting to look a little tired however, and the pool(s) were a bit of a disappointment... not much room for sunbeds and generally dated. This also goes for parts of the hotel itself which are quite cavernous (like the home of a villain in a 1970s James Bond movie) but lacking in atmosphere. All in all, a good base for getting away from it all and visiting local tourist sites, but showing it's age slightly.",Positive
This was a nice hotel but very crowded and a little impersonal. However I was greeted by the loveliest staff- who upgraded us to another suite. It was perfect for our honeymoon visit in Sri Lanka. We opted room service over dinner and it was delicious and prompt The highlight were the views and watching the monkeys play outside while we showered- it was entertaining. Impressive hotel though not genuine warm experience from all staff. Caters to locals more than travellers from overseas and lacks some charm.,Positive
"This hotel is built into the rocks - the design is really spectacular. You have wonderful views over the surrounding countryside and monkeys climb on the structure and peek into your room. Its a quiet hotel - ideal for couples or families with kids who don't need entertaining. Mine are 5 and 7 and were fine. The food is really good - lots of local stuff. It isn't perfect. The service can sometimes be a bit snooty and you get massive groups of locals visiting who are paying a fraction of the price us foreigners are charged. However, I don;t think a trip to the region is complete without a stay at Kandalama.",Positive
"The hotel is situated in the middle of a jungle, but the access road was decently maintained. So an easy ride even in a car.Almost everything about the hotel was great from the scenery, to Jeffrey Bawa's iconic architecture, to friendly staff, to excellent rooms, to great dining offerings. However, the hotel was not prepared to serve a full house of guests on our first night making us wait in a que for a table at the restaurant. It was a case of pure indecisiveness as the hotel apparently had been facing the same issue for several days. Apart from that, it was a wonderful experience, where even our 1 year old baby was highly enjoying.",Positive
"Great Hotel with a beautiful view all around. Friendly staff, great food. Dilini Rajapakshe from the reservations helped us in selecting good and suitable rooms as we had a paralysed patient with us.Rooms with sigiri view & dambullu view was made available for us. Surprise birthday cake was given to us on our fathers birthday which made our stay more happier and memorable.",Positive
Very nice hotel with good and clean rooms. Worth of money. recommend for visiting. We spent two nights. Swimming pool view is super cool. I give 4* because the taxi service is soo expensive.,Positive
"The design of the hotel and the way it blends into the jungle is impressive. Our room was very nice with a splendid bathroom and lovely views of the lake but a bit dark because of the vines growing down the front of the hotel. However the monkeys use these to move around and it was worth a bit of loss of light to see them on our balcony. We stayed for 3 nights and visited Dambulla, Sygria and did the Elephant safari. All very enjoyable, especially the elephants. We were half board and the food was very good but not spectacular. A few minus points. The bar area was soulless. The decor was dark and not welcoming although to be fair the bar staff were. Also the pool area just had a few beds and no umbrellas. However we spent most of our days out so this wasn't a big deal for us. It is a hotel suitable for a few nights stay to see the sights of the area but I would not recommend it to someone who wanted to stay for a week and just chill out.",Positive
"We stayed here for 3 nights during a 2 week tour of Sri Lanka. What a fantastic hotel. The location is super. The hotel is overlooking a gorgeous lake and the hotel itself blends in so well to the surrounding area. It was designed by Geoffrey Bawa and we found ourselves seeking out other bits of his work during our stay in Sri Lanka. Our room was spacious with a great bathroom. We were told to watch out for the monkeys so we kept our balcony door closed. 3 swimming pools in the complex and the infinity pool over the lake was our favourite. As mentioned in other reviews there is a need for more beds by the pools and umbrellas would be a great addition too. The staff in the hotel were fantastic. So welcoming and friendly. The food in the buffet restaurant was gorgeous. Breakfast was amazing as was dinner. Fabulous choice and quality. There was music every night in the lounge off the restaurant. Hotel is in a great location for Siguriya, caves in Dambulla and elephant safari in Kaudulla. I thought we would see a handful of elephants but we saw 300-400. We also went to Polonnaruwa from here. A tip if you are going there or the caves is to bring a pair of socks as you can't wear shoes in some sites and the ground was rough and ROASTING! I would absolutely stay in this fantastic hotel again. Some more beds and umbrellas around the pools and it would be 5 stars.",Positive
"We stayed here for 2 nights on a 2 week SL tour. First impressions were awful after 6 emails before our stay were ignored and an eventual reply was quite rude. On arrival I asked to see the manager. I spoke to the guest relation manager about the emails. She was kind but not very helpful. In the end things got sorted out but no apology for lack of communication was ever made. It seemed the staff didn't care too much. From there on things did improve - we had booked a suite and stayed in room 415 ( I think). Great views, massive room. Langurs all around us - fantastic breakfast buffet with, oh thanks, brown bread and so much choice. Evening buffet also high quality - crazy but amazing hotel, it is quite spectacular A few more comments- hotel has 3 good size pools. That is great news as it is a large hotel BUT.... no landscaping around pools and only 15 sun loungers for all! That is not acceptable. There is plenty of space for more loungers. - no nice bar area - no nice lunch restaurant If they would create the above, this hotel would be amazing. The highlight for us was meeting the lovely guy who runs the Eco park Would we stay again? I think so. The location and jungle setting are really worthwhile.",Negative
"My partner and I stayed here for two nights while we stayed in Dambulla. The staff were very nice, although a slight language barrier at times. The hotel was nice but was quite dated, the paint was coming off in some parts and a bit of rust was starting to form in the shower area. Other than that we had no issues, the buffet dinner was great and the view from the pool was definitely the best part! I think if we stay here again we will pay to stay in a better room.",Positive
"This hotel designed by Sir Geoffrey Bawa snuggles into a hillside in a nature park. Rooms are large, somewhat dated and beds poor. Food standards are really good -- congratulations Chef. Pools are not really for swimming. But if visits to the cultural triangle is your reason for staying then a good base from which to travel.",Positive
"What a hotel. Great vision to build this, views are spectacular . Service is great, Food was brilliant, the buffers were brilliant and plenty of choice for all tastes. Three swimming pools to choice from, and plenty of places to visit out side the hotel. The hotel has been around for a while and now is beginning to show signs of age.",Positive
"We went in Nov. kind of raining season. I was really worry about bugs & mosquitoes when booking this hotel since it's in the mountain but turned out it wasn't too bad at all. the room was quite clean. We love the breakfast, the food was great. The pool has beautiful view.",Positive
"I would like to rate this hotel as good, as it is neither average or very good. We stayed her based on a recommendation of a friend and although there are many good points we did feel that the hotel is a bit tired and the staff not as responsive as they could be. Positive side first the hotel is built into the side of a hill and the views are stunning. It is reasonable convenient located for the cultural triangle sites and the food is good. The wildlife is wonderful you have the constant presence of monkeys. Sadly what otherwise could have been an excellent hotel is let down by a number of factors. Firstly whatever they say a ""Superior Room"" is a basic room. We were staying in the Dambulla Wing on the 5th floor. I would recommend not going to any lower floor as your views will be restricted. Our room was dark and looked tired and in need of redecoration. They only give you one key, which is inconvenient if there is two of you The bathrooms looked tired and needed upgrading, no bathrobe or bath. There are three pools, an infinity pool which gives a spectacular view over the lake, a small pool with a rock bottom and a pool at the end of the Dambulla wing. Sadly there is limited space to sit by the pool and a couple of times we weren't able to find somewhere to sit. The pool at the end of the Dambulla wing is the quietest. Service at the bar is slow, mainly I suspect because there are too few staff to service the need. If you want somewhere to stay near the Cultural triangle this is fine, but don't spend too much time at the hotel",Negative
"Spent 3 nights here during which time we visited nearby Sigirya Rock and also went on elephant safari. Hotel is unique, carved into a rock face in the jungle. Monkeys are ever present. Amusing to watch but don’t be tempted to feed them. Hotel has great views over huge lake with Sigirya on the distance. Good facilites, 3 pools, good food. Room was fine but in need of an update. Apparently a programme of renovation is planned later this year. Good base for exploring the various attractions in the area.",Positive
"We stayed one night and the weather was horrible so we didn’t enjoy it as much as we could have. The architecture is amazing, and from the lake it’s quite hard to spot the 150 room hotel. Very good not excellent because the restaurant was very noisy and more of a canteen than restaurant feel to it. Our mid range rooms were lovely, but we couldn’t sit outside on our balcony to enjoy the view or the monkeys because we were overwhelmed by the noise of a huge generator. The lake safari advertised didn’t exist, and the lake boat trip was pretty hopeless and a bit boring tbh.",Negative
"Buffet (breakfast and dinner) offers a wide variety including live stations. The food was excellent.  The fine dining restaurant provided some great food too. The bathroom was spacious and the shower was great. Coco Spa provided a brilliant massage. The views from the hotel grounds were beautiful. A good check in & check out service. The rooms (apart from the bathrooms) could do with some updating. The bed wasn’t that comfortable. The air conditioning unit when switched off would make an annoying sound, and therefore we had to keep it on so we wouldn’t be disturbed whilst sleeping.  The bed frame would make a squeaking noise every time you moved which could get irritating. They have a snooker table in the hotel, but you have to pay to play which I would have assumed would have been free for hotel guests. Would I stay at this hotel again? Yes.Would I recommend this hotel to friends and family? Yes.Any additional comments: provide those celebrating special occasions such as a honeymoon, either a room upgrade or discount on the spa.",Positive
"This is an amazingly designed and built hotel in the middle of nowhere. The entrance is through a cave and the views from Reception and the upper floors are spectacular. The vines growing all over the outside make it seem as if its growing out of the jungle. But......our room 301 was very tired, not particularly clean, the toilet flush handle was badly corroded, the shower and toilet bowl not particularly clean and we had to ask for towels for our room. Because it was on a lower floor we had a very restricted view which was disappointing and it wasn't really a ""Luxury"" King room as sold. The staff were very friendly despite the fact there are so many groups of tourists passing through which makes it feel very impersonal. he breakfast was very average but the restaurant upstairs was great - the service and food were excellent. This is a must see hotel because of the architecture and location but its not somewhere I would choose to say again.",Negative
"Stayed here for 2 nights at the beginning of our tour round Sri Lanka.Should have stayed for 3 nights. We had a panarama view room, it was lovely room with a fantastic view of the lake. Such a great setting for a hotel. Buffet dinner was good as was the buffer breakfast. Main pool was ok. It did have a fantastic view. Loved the monkeys although this did stop us being able to open our patio door.",Positive
"We checked in about 11:30 PM so we got our first good look the next morning. This is a beautiful hotel which is cut into rock; it is a sparse building with large open hallways that run alongside the jungle. Boulders occupy the hallways in various places. A unique property architecturally speaking. You arrive on the 5th floor - there are a total of 7 floors. Luckily for us, we got the room on the 4th floor at the very end of the hallway which meant a long walk back to the lobby, but the reward was that the side wall of the room which was the end of the building was floor to ceiling windows. We awoke the next morning to the sight of hot air balloons rising over the lake. Evening view was the sunset. We had a basic room which was just big enough for 2. If you are sightseeing, you won't be spending much time there anyway. Breakfast was a huge buffet with Sri Lankan hoppers, rice and curry, eggs any which way, and a table with at least a dozen different types of southeast Asian fruit. Monkeys roam about and one visited me as I took my shower - the both of us looking at each other through the outside glass. Massages at the spa were excellent.We chanced upon a flutist playing on the west end of the property on one of the enormous rocks by a pool. Beautiful way to watch sun set. It would have been better if the hotel let you know about this or any other activity that takes place.",Positive
"Staying for 3 nights as a base for tge ancient capitals and Buddhist shrines. The hotel is a little tired, but clean and well looked after. Staff are excellent and food has been very good. The gotel is quite unique in terms of its green credentials. Great views from our room. We would recommend.",Positive
"The hotel is definitely in a beautiful setting, but consider if it is the place for you. We travelled with two kids 7 and 13, and they were close to being the only kids in the hotel. Pools are OK (especially at fa end of Dambulla wing which seemed to be kept a secret, we had it all to our self) but pool areas not very appealing and lack simple ameneties such as sunbeds. OK, most people come to tour the area, but when the pool attendabt excuses the fact that there are only 8 sunbeds around the pool ‘because the others are broken’ - not a 5 star hotel...Restaurant has an excellent buffet with large selection that changes every day. But why they insist on indoor seating in stead of utilizing the large outdoor lawn, remains a mysteryRooms are spacious and nice, and the monkeys a real treat - not the leadt for the kids.Hotel design is probably a bit like the modern holy graal of Sri Lanka due to the fame of Sir Geoffrey, but honestly... the long corridors open towards the rock side are about as exciting (and similar to) many multi story car parks I have seen. Common spaces had an absolute lack of cozyness. Staff very friendly and helpful.",Positive
"After a careful research of all hotels in this area, I opted for this one because of its unique architecture with greenery and stunning views from some rooms displayed in the hotel website and last but not the least all the rave reviews on tripadvisor. The company owns quite a few other properties, which are highly rated and regarded across Sri Lanka. However, my experience of two nights stay did not live up to my expectations. First, my room no.344 was below ground level without any views. What a disappointment! Next, the distance between my room and the main dining hall on the sixth floor, was quite a long walk. In between there would be two slow moving elevator rides. The room was fairly tired and not maintained properly. The telephone instrument was stinking and electric kettle filled with thick dregs. Dinner buffet was part of the package and it was fairly widespread. I loved the section where they lined up local Sri Lankan dishes. Service standards lacked consistency. I am going with four out of five mainly because of its unique location.",Negative
"Clean modern hotel, if a little tired in its decorations. Good size bedroom and bathroom. No bath though, and the shower leaked water all over the bathroom floor. We reported this on the first day but nothing was done about it in the four days were there. The staff were very friendly and polite especially the room service (Damish and Chadhura were five star). The food was good for a four star hotel with plenty of choice, both Sri Lankan and European. Entertainment in the evenings provided a nice local musical background. The hotel is almost a kilometre from end to end so be prepared for some walking. The outlook from our balcony was stunning as you look out over the jungle to the lake.",Positive
"Located in the heart of the cultural triangle with relatively easy access to Sigiriya and the Dambulla cave temples this is a very popular short term stay for tourists of all nationalities. Interesting design on the top of a granite outcrop with minimal intrusion to the neighbouring eco system the hotel is unusual and not without charm. However some of the facilities are looking a little tired and the whole enterprise seems vaguely amateurish and quaint.Rooms are just about okay for a hotel of this supposed quality but the waterfall shower is powerful and invigorating. The buffet in the restaurant is great value for money though, to my mind, trying to cater to all tastes without ever pleasing anyone. It’s sister hotel in Negombo is a great example of how it should be done.Wi-fi is free but very slow and although the staff are uniformly lovely the service is pretty haphazard. Notwithstanding this I would still recommend the hotel for a short stay.",Positive
"Good quality hotel in forest and lakeside location. Stayed for 3 nights. Allocated room on first night was located near bar area and under the main restaurant. Very noisy so asked to move. Hotel management team arranged a quieter room for the remaining stay. Standard of accommodation and food selection is very good. Great hotel for seeing monkeys and assorted bird life as close quarters. Hotel is within driving distance of minneriya national park to see elephants, sigiriya lion rock and polonnaruwa.",Positive
"We stayed here for 3 nights recently. Excellent food friendly helpful waiters , we preferred the buffet to the a la carte . Wonderful location overlooking the lake , crafted into the jungle, saw elephants drinking .Bathroom could be updated .Generally recommended .",Positive
the hotel is nice.the location is okay.but we did not like the food variety.we did not feel there is a variety of food to satisfy all needs.the room was great.very clean and very nice view.in the middle of nature,Positive
"We had high expectations we sitting done, considering the price level. The food served had high quality and tasted delicious but very long wait for food, no presentation of food and the bill arrived on our table without us asking for it.",Positive
"Yes, it’s an architectural wonder, a man made extension of the landscape, and it occupies a perch to kill for, poised between the majestic Kandalama lake and the dense forest. And the world has dutifully honoured it for its merits, labeling it as a must visit on any traveller’s bucket list. And I also read somewhere that it is arguably the longest hotel on the planet (I do emphasise my lack of absolute facts in relation to this). It certainly felt so; the walk from one wing to another may take up to fifteen minutes after negotiating such obstacles like lifts and stairs. This was my third visit, after a lapse of almost twenty years. We had booked for two days and I couldn’t wait.But we stepped in to chaos. It was milling with tourists with more buses streaming in and the staff were struggling to cope. It seemed like a serious case of demand outstripping supply, at least from a service angle. It took almost thirty minutes for us to be served with the welcome drinks. I must say that an assortment of drinks made from wood apple, king coconut, the Beli Fruit and one other, fetched heaven to our drought stricken tongues. The front desk manager was pathetically stretched between all the in-comings, and seemed to go through the motions with a rehearsed smile and a standard jumble of words, flitting across each group. Finally we were led to our rooms. This time we got the 4th floor in the Dambulla wing. The view from the balcony was mediocre at best, with just a few snippets of the lake breaking through the trees and the foliage. But cannot blame the management for this since the hotel was heavily booked and we couldn’t gain admittance to the more aesthetically prone Sigiriya wing with its views of the historical Sigiriya rock fortress. Our triple bedroom was seriously cramped by the three beds, we had to execute dangerous little hops to get to our luggage. It felt claustrophobic and my older son and my wife immediately gave me the “Not Impressed Look”. The wifi and cable tv managed to soothe my eight year old eventually. More woes of a domestic kind cropped up: a partly broken flush handle, absence of a bath tub for my kids, delays in room service, brought home the painful truth that the best of hotels may lose its glamour and appeal if the service levels falter. But the buffet was vintage Kandalama, nothing had changed. The food choices were irresistible. Sadly, we decided scrap the second day and try some place new. I enjoyed the grand elephant ride through forest and lake the following morning. Have I fallen out of love with Kandalama? Now that impossible. But the management needs to consider that ecology and architecture alone may not be sufficient going forward.",Negative
We were welcomed by a choice of juice and cool towels. The staff were very nice and the view was spectacular. We were surrounded be monkeys and other weird and wonderful wildlife.The road to the hotel was hard to navigate but it paid off when we got there. The view was really beautiful.,Positive
"We arrived a little early but were greeted very cheerfully with a glass of fruit juice. Our room had double aspect windows which afforded spectacular views of Kandalama lake. A little dated possibly but the uniqueness of the hotel by far out-ways any negatives about the room. Be warned to keep your balcony doors not only closed but locked. We were warned that the local monkey population can open unlocked doors and you'll be greeted by a monkey party in your room upon your return.We made a mistake by not eating at the buffet but ate at the cafe Kachchan on the ground floor which was western food , done poorly. Altogether a very enjoyable visit which I would hope to repeat one day.",Positive
"Very interesting hotel built into the jungle and rock-face: stunning architecture by Bawa. Very good food, mostly buffets but with an excellent fine dining restaurant with superb curries. Good location for all the cultural sites including Sigiriya. Friendly staff, well kept grounds, ideal for families but with enough breakout areas for couples as well.",Positive
The location of the hotel is extremely good. Looks like you are living in a jungle. Fantastic view. Pools is also very good. Staff is mostly good. You must not leave the window open as there are a lot of monkeys which can create trouble if they enter the room. Don't feed the monkeys.,Positive
"Our third time here. Our family and cousins booked 4 rooms and stayed for 2 nights. Because of the peak holiday season it was over priced. Sometimes make you think it’s not worth the money, specially when there are so many new hotels coming up.However the service, food and staff were excellent as they used to be. The biggest advantage of this hotel is the unique location and the amazing architecture. Views of the lake is breathtaking.Perhaps rooms needs updating and renovation since time has taken it’s toll.",Positive
Great location and amazing place to sit and watch the lake and the distant views. The hotel is built into the side of the hill and looks as if it merges with the forest. Good selection of food available to suit all tastes and we stayed for 4 nights. We particularly enjoyed some of the oriental/Chinese food which you wouldn't expect.,Positive
"The outstanding thing about the Heritance Kandalama is its location, nestled on a hillside surrounded by jungle with sweeping views of the lake. Rooms are a good size and many (perhaps all?) have small balconies. The hotel is starting to show its age - it was opened in the 90's but has a bit of a 70's retro feel to it - but has a relaxed, friendly atmosphere and reasonable facilities. It's a bit off the main road and less convenient than, for example, Habarana if you are trying to fit in a lot of sights in a short time. But if you are not in a rush, then an afternoon relaxing around the Heritance's infinity pool and enjoying the beautiful jungle, lake and wildlife is a memorable experience.",Positive
"I did extensive research on where to stay in the Cultural Triangle, looking for a five-star accommodation that provided excellent value for money - and Kandalama was the perfect choice for its price point. Location: excellent - about 15-20 minutes to both Dambulla caves and Sigiryia, an hour to Minnerya Park, and a bit further to Polonnaruwa.Hotel/Room: the architecture and how the hotel blends in with the mountain/forest truly is pretty incredible. I saw reviews about how far the rooms were from the common areas, but I didn't find it to be that far at all, and we were almost to the end of one of the wings. Our room was in the Sigiryia room on the 3rd floor, and you could indeed see the rock mountain in the distance, albeit pretty far away. The room itself was clean and comfortable, a cabin-y feel with lots of dark wood, the bathroom was updated and the shower was INCREDIBLE (hard water pressure rain-style shower, and it was up against the full glass wall so you felt like you were showering in the forest!) I also didn't find bugs to be a problem in the room at all - they must do a good job spraying because despite the many bugs in the hallways (you are literally in a forest, after all) we didn't see any in our room. Food/Service: the food was decent. We ate buffet the whole time because we had half board and I'd say it was worth it, since we were out all day sightseeing. Service was also decent considering how many guests there are - you're not coming here looking for a 1:1 staff to guest ratio, after all.Overall I was very happy with my stay at Kandalama, it was the perfect choice for the price point if you want luxury but you're going to be out sightseeing all day and don't think it's worth paying up to the $500+/night of Vil Uyana or Water Gardens.",Positive
"This is a delightful hotel built into the rock face set amidst jungle. Monkeys and birds abound. Three pools, one an infinity pool. Excellent food. Breakfast extensive. Nothing too much trouble. Spa available but didn't use. Good for visiting Sigirya and Dambulla Rock caves. Only downside was drain smell but this could have been as a result of where our room was - at the far end of the hotel. Room 342.p",Positive
"Substantial offering by local architect Geoffrey Bawa. Follows the typical concrete construction favoured throughout Sri Lanka however the standard of finish is high (although some itms are beginning to show their age) and the structure nestles in to the bush with surprising ease. Breathtaking views.Heaps of monkeys. local safaris recommended for birds & elephants.Great infinity pool (one of 3 pools). Breakfast is an overwhelming international & local buffet, dinner is either a la carte or themed buffet. Friendly & efficient staff.",Positive
"We stayed at Heritance Kandalama over Christmas & we had an enjoyable stay! The pool area in particular is utterly breathtaking & the rooms were super spacious & clean. The staff are friendly however they are very laid back so be prepared for waiting times - it took us almost 45 minutes to get a cappuccino and over 30 mins just to check in. There seems to be a lack of communication between the staff, however it wasn't a major problem and I would still recommend this hotel.",Positive
Stayed in this hotel for three nights as part of an organised tour of Sri Lanka. The hotel is very long and built into the country side with views over the jungle and a large lake. The bathroom had a glass wall looking out onto the jungle. It was a strange sensation showering with monkeys looking at you. Didn’t use the balcony as it appeared to be always occupied by monkeys which we didn’t want getting into the room. I think it had a couple of swimming pools. A large restaurant with a good choice of local and international food.,Positive
We stayed here for 3 nights on our recent trip to Sri Lanka. It is in a beautiful location overlooking the lake with views across to Sigirya Rock in the distance. We had a room looking out into the jungle which made it quite dark and the furniture on the balcony was not comfortable enough to sit and relax on after a day of sight seeing. One tip would be to ask for a room with a view over the lake. We had breakfast and dinner included and meals were buffet style with a good selection of both curries and western food.,Positive
"What can one say about the fantastic architecture of this hotel that hasn't been said before - it is an amazing design, only let down by the local building standards. The one design fault is the bathtub/shower in the Deluxe rooms, which is very difficult to get in and out of due to it being around 1/2 metre off the ground - old people or anyone with a knee problem would really struggle to have a shower/bath. The food is really good, although the food portions from the café and in-room dining are massive, way too much for one person!On a very serious note, it was downright dangerous to see that the grill service during the evening buffet was cooking prawns on the same grill as other food. When we enquired about this as my wife wanted stir-fried noodles and is very allergic to shellfish, the chefs indicated that they didn't have a vegetarian-only grill, much less a surface not contaminated by shellfish. Again, this can be very dangerous, if not deadly, for people with shellfish allergies, and the kitchen management should strive to have a separate grill for people with shellfish and other allergies.Also, it would be nice for guests to be able to pour their own milk into their tea/coffee, as Sri Lankans do not seem to know the meaning of 'just a dash of milk' - but this is a question of poor training. This is also evident when they pour beer - in frosted glasses and without a head!The service was good, despite a hiccup during check-in, but it was frustrating that when my wife signed the bills, the staff came back to tell us that her name didn't match the name on the booking - perhaps the bill should specify Booking name as opposed to Guest name.The swimming pools are quite spectacular even though we didn't have time to swim. Unfortunately, as we keep experiencing in SL, the pillows were dreadfully soft, leaving me with a sore neck during and after our stay. The Coco Spa is highly recommended, staffed by Indonesian ladies who provide amazing massages! Definitely worth a visit as a base to visit Sigiriya Rock, but we left feeling somewhat disappointed by our experience - perhaps we had expected too much after hearing all the hype about this being the best hotel in SL. On a final note, the hotel should really consider paving the entrance from the village road.",Positive
A little off the beaten path but great hotel! Great staff and rooms. Beautiful pools. Only downside is that you’re stuck paying hotel prices for average food catered to tourist especially for dinner as it is not convenient to get anywhere else.,Positive
"We stayed here in late October for a credit card offer. We had a warm welcome & the staff at the reception was very polite & helpful. Booked a superior double room but upon arrived they upgraded it to a suite.Room was very spacious as it was suite. It had a separate living area with chairs. Even though the room was bit old, cleanliness & neatness of the room and the bathroom was up to high standards. Bath room was well equipped.Had three swmming pools, where one is nearly 1/3 of the floor area is a natural rock which is called Natural Pool. Inifinity pool should be the largest among three & the most elegant one. It has a very nice design. Food.. We were on half board this time.. I've been to this hotel twice before.. every time, food was really good.. Very large buffets with lots of variety.. Being a vegetarian, I could find lots of dishes here.. For meat lovers, of course, you too have lots of different dishes there..We had one incident when we were near the natural pool. When we asked for pool towels from a staff member, he showed us where the towels are stored which is about some steps down.. he was not a in a position to bring it for us. so we brought it by ourselves. But in the next moment, when a foreigner came & asked for towels, he asked him back the count & he brought it from down for the foriegner. When it comes to 5 star standards, no way we can have this kind of different treatment for foreigners & locals. This was a very bad experience for us. I strongly believe hotel should take actions to avoid this kind of incidents in future.Apart from the above incident, it was a very good stay at Heritance Kandalama.",Positive
one of my favorite hotels in the world. i stayed there 5 times this time something went wrong by checkin in the room; we were welcomed as usual with a drink near the infinity pool. the girl came to pick us up your roomm is ready. we went into the room and housekeepin was still in the process of cleanin the windows. maybe dubbelcheck before bringing the guest to the room. We had complimentary fruits and at the bathroom extra's aswell as mouthwas and comb. NEVER before was this avaible. the staff is verry friendsly only not so fluent in english. good my friend is sri lankan so he could translate things for me<; after all it was nice to be at this oasis of piece and getting relax and became one with nature. super hotel hope to go back again . the man who did the check out was not so communicative<; just asked roomnummer and creditcard and that was it. normaly they ask about your experience but this time verry cool and unpersonal check out,Positive
"Kandalama is a great base for exploring the central regions of Sri Lanka including Polunuwarra, Sigiriya and Dambulla. It is also close to the national park where you can go on an elephant safari. The hotel's location on the shore of a lake is absolutely stunning. The staff are very professional and the the place is very well run. The cuisine at the a la carte restaurant was exceptional and very good value for money. Most of the visitors seemed to prefer the buffet restaurant but we didn't try it.The architecture of the hotel wasnt to my taste. I found it a bit gloomy and austere and there were some real design fails in our room but that said I'd happy stay there again because of the location.And the main pool is quite stunning!",Positive
"The Heritance Kandalama is well designed to merge in with the beautiful, lush greenery all around. The view of the lake, the rampant monkeys visiting the room balconies truly make you feel one with nature. The restaurant has a buffet for all meals and quite a wide spread of food. It can get a little chaotic when the hotel is fully booked and unfortunately the wait staff are just not interested in being helpful. No eye contact or welcoming smiles. The front office staff though are warm and helpful. The rooms are poorly lit and a little tired. There was a gentleman playing a flute at sunset near the infinity pool and that was a surreal experience. The review has an extra star purely because of the location and number of stars visible at night. For a city dweller that experience is unparalleled!",Positive
"The location is fabulous. The design of the building merging nature with construction is awesome. The view from the room was breath taking. The walk to and from the diner was always refreshing. The breakfast was good, with a healthy mix of continental and Sri Lankan menu. The employees are very courteous. One feels most welcome here!!",Positive
"We had read a lot about this hotel and wanted to make the journey to stay here for a night. The hotel is literally hidden amongst the natural beauty of the area and the views of the lake are absolutely stunning! It did not start off too well hence I've given 4 stars - check in took almost one hour - I had to prompt them at this point and then they swiftly gave us a room. Unfortunately they gave us a twin bed room with a forest view when we had paid for a king bed room with lake views. A phone call to the manager and within 15 mins we were moving rooms..to our surprise we had been given an even nicer room which had a jacuzzi overlooking the lake in the very far distance! The dinner buffet was varied and delicious,I felt that the desserts looked stunning but the cakes were dry and the passion cheesecake dessert lacked flavour. The best dessert was the chocolate cup with fruit. We also arrived at 1950 for dinner with the buffet opening at 1930 and we had to wait in a long queue for a table as the hall was full. We woke up to watch the sunrise the following day which was incredible! I highly recommend this from the infinity pool area. Breakfast was better because we went as soon as it opened as we were awake for the sunrise. Good selection but I felt the fresh juices could have been colder and more varied. We then had a walk towards the lake and met an elephant on the way which was amazing. Plenty of wildlife around the hotel including monkeys, lizards, different birds and bats in the evening. Overall a very enjoyable stay and I would highly recommend it. Hotel is starting to become a bit dated and perhaps some rooms/areas need a bit of a refurbishment however.",Positive
"We had stay only one night at the Heritance Kandalama.Location is perfect, breathtaking views from every single point ( we stayed at panoramic room ). Very good breakfast! And i fall in love with infinity pool, absolutely didn't want to leave it :) But the quality of service quite is poor. Check in took almost an hour. Nobody gave wifi password ( we had to go all the way back to reception to get it). Also we were needed a HDMI cabel for an hour, i called reception and they said they will call me back, but there were no calls after 1.5 hour , so i went to the front door, where i was told simply? 'no, we have only adapters' ( Seriously ???! There is a huge conference room on the top floor and they dont have a HDMI . I also had a feeling, that guy at reception didnt even understand what i was asking for :)  And the last thing...Dinner. We decided to not take half board and have a dinner at restaurant.We were very surprise by poor quality of food. Mayo from the shop instead homemade lime aioli (how its said in the menu). My mahi mahi had very strong fish taste (not nice) and pork belly dish, was overcooked, hard and it was not a belly :) We were told, (by waiter) that they are using imported pork from Australia. But , when we asked where are they getting that pork, we found out that its a local produce (which we dont mind, just what was the point to tell from the beginning that its imported ?! ) :) Check out was so ""cold and unfriendly"" nobody had a small talk, nobody even did we enjoy our stay and etc.Don't want to be too picky, But the management HAS to improve the service! The hotel has such a great potential to be an amazing place. And the restaurant could be number one... Just need some more work. Anyway we enjoyed our stay. PS: better book on the workdays, because hotel getting full on weekend.",Negative
"At first glance this hotel might look out of place, with its weird colour and concrete exterior. But then you get it! It's supposed to blend in with nature and it has! You're connected to nature at all times, the swimming pool, the corridors, your room! Mind you there will be geckos in your room but if you can ignore everything else is excellent. Very clean, huge rooms with great views. Do keep your balcony doors locked and shut otherwise monkeys certainly know their way in!! Overall great stay, enormous buffet breakfast and dinner, different menu each day! Excellent friendly service by smiling personel!",Positive
"Continuing our tour of Sri Lanka stayed at the Heritance Kandalama for two nights in a superior room. Located in a spectacular setting the Hotel nestles against the natural surroundings and faces a magnificent lake and open countryside. The views are stunning and the Hotel designed by Geoffrey Bawa (whose house we visited later in Columbo) has wonderful open spaces but always feels part of the landscape. Reception is in an open area as you arrive and the welcome is warm, efficient and friendly. Many parts of the Hotel capitalise on the views to the fabulous countryside and our room (number 528) faced the lake but just need to close the balcony doors as otherwise the monkeys will get in the room. A Good sized room with tea/coffee making facilities, safe, fridge, mini-bar (charged) and reasonable storage and drawer space but could do with a general updating although we appreciate the attempt to keep a character consistent with the surroundings. Comfortable bed but no robes or slippers although two bottles of water a day were free. Large WC/Walk in Shower/Wash area. First night we dined in the Kanchana Restaurant which offered an extensive buffet choice but was incredibly noisy. Full of children and the staff on the clearing station seemed to be having a competition as to who could make most noise clattering crockery. Early breakfast was a much more civilised affair. On the second night we dined a la carte in Kaludiya (book a table) where great food and excellent service combined with a much more tranquil atmosphere. Overall a pleasant stay but if you are not travelling as part of a tour it is quite isolated. All staff we met were helpful, friendly and efficient.",Positive
"4th hotel on our Sri Lankan tour and as Phil and Kirsty would say ""location location location"" makes this hotel. Built into a rock in the jungle this hotel is also on the edge of a lake. Stunning.The rooms are a little tired looking and could do with some updating but very nice. We had a huge jacuzzi bath with a view over the lake which was a welcome relief at the end of a long day. The best banana bubble bath as well.Nice restaurant with buffet offer or on the floor above a la carte if you prefer. We ate in both and both good. Preferred the a la carte as the buffet was very busy. 155 rooms approx with lots of coach loads of groups arriving, so it's a busy hotel. All the staff were very friendly and great service.Really enjoyed our 3 nights here and would recommend. Not that expensive for room service/ bar etc when you consider its remote location. Easy to visit all the cultural triangle attractions as well from here",Positive
"Kandalama is the perfect base from which to explore Sri Lanka’s fascinating cultural triangle and wilderness.With three pools, multiple restaurants and wide open spaces it is easy to spend a few days at the resort or to enjoy the many activities that can be arranged from there.The sumptuous buffet meals are perfect for large groups as there was something for everyone! The Sri Lankan fare did not disappoint!",Positive
"We stayed at Heritance Kandalama for 3 nights at the start of our 8 day tour of Sri Lanka. The hotel is in a great location for visiting Dambulla and Sigiriya, both of which ate within a 30 minute drive. The hotel itself is in a fantastic setting with amazing views of the Kandalama Lake. I'm told that if you are lucky you can see wild elephants at the lake in mornings and evenings, however we weren't fortunate enough to see these. We stayed in a Luxury Room which was clean and very spacious. Room service was also available which we found useful after a busy day of sightseeing. The only downside I would say about this hotel would be the buffet restaurant which we found to be quite expensive for lunch and dinner ($26pp).I would recommend eating at Cafe Kachchan which is the hotel's pool bar and overlooks the infinity pool. The food here is of great quality and is reasonably priced. You are also able to wear shorts, whereas trousers are required in the buffet restaurant. Cafe Kachchan is currently ranked 4th out of all the restaurants in Dambulla.",Positive
The location and ambiance is very special from the infinity pool to the views in very direction.the rooms are well appointed and the buffets for breakfast and dinner both first rate. Staff are friendly and efficient. It would have been a perfect score but for the slow checkout which involves going into poky room and queuing to see the overworked and harrassed cashier With so many staff elsewhere this is just incomprehensible.,Positive
"Great location and ambiance in the middle of the jungle beside the lake far away from the city. Pleasant facilities. Good service. Acceptable food. Clean, customer and environmental friendly. Food price high.",Positive
"Kandalama is situated in a lovely remote location in Dambulla. The hotel itself is blended nicely into the nature and provides a unique experience for anyone. There are 3 pools in the hotel and the infinity pool provides a unique experience overlooking the lake.The hotel provides a broad variety of food (the best for me!) both local and international menu. However, the hotel is beginning to show ageing issues and I've witnessed cleanliness issues during my stay.Monkeys are a nuisance at this hotel. The hotel displays warnings at all rooms. Just be sure not to keep the balcony doors open!",Positive
Stayed here for a couple of days to climb the Sigiriya Rock. Very comfortable rooms. good buffet dinner and breakfast with western and Sri Lankan dishes included.Interesting hotel built into a rock. you can ride and bathe an elephant as my niece did at a cost if that is your thing and watch out for the monkeys who populate the hotel grounds.Early evening a flutist plays just off the swimming pool which makes the ambience great.Service is good and as the hotel is fairly an old one a little refurbishment would not go astray. All in all a very good experience.,Positive
"I had heard a lot about this hotel and when I had chance to visit Sri Lanka, I ensured that I stay here for Atleast 1 night. Luckily I had two nights in this beautiful property. Their welcome service and check in process is amazing. You don't see the hotel till you come at the entrance, it is designed inside the cave and hidden with all the greenery around. The infinity pool has superb view of Kandalama lake. Rooms are amazing, quite spacious. Only problem is that they have very limited light so it becomes difficult to read something in the room. All rooms have balcony with view of lake. It is advisable to keep the balcony close as many insects and monkeys roam outside. With regards to food, they buffet is very large and has many options. Caution for vegetarian as they have literally only 1-2 options in vegetarian. We faced problem on day one dinner buffet as there was no veg option, thankfully chef was very kind and understanding, he prepared veg pasta for us on the house. Next day, they kept many veg options. My advise, request the hotel in advance. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Overall, amazing property and worth staying!",Positive
"Reviews and official descriptions of this place are misleading. This is not a luxury hotel, it is an ecolodge surrounded by nature which allows to enjoy beautiful views and observe wildlife in a comfortable setting. Mindful of that, you'll have a pleasant stay, but if, like me, you're expecting five stars treatment you'll be disappointed. Rooms are rather small and nothing special, there's no way to regulate the air con, wifi is spotty and unavailable in several places around the property. Service is overall alright, but staff ranges widely between nice and helpful and rude and dismissive.Food was very good at the bar and at both restaurants, however the breakfast hall which also serves as buffet restaurant in the evenings it's a mad house catering too many people at the same time with not enough waitresses and terrible acoustics which makes it incredibly loud",Negative
"The hotel location is spectacular. Wonderful views, amazing wildlife and close enough to other attractions to visit in a day. We stayed in a suite. The room we were given and had to stay in on the first night did not match the hotel's website description. There was no balcony, despite this being described as a feature of every suite. Plus the low down, back corner aspect meant there was no view and a lot of darkness (even the monkeys, which were delightfully in abundance elsewhere made no appearance to this dingy spot!). The hotel did move us the next day to a front facing room with balcony, which was much better. Comfortable, great views, but with little character inside. The service was friendly if slow in places. We did feel the regulation 1 bottle of water per person per day was a little stingy in a hot country where tap water isn't drinkable. Some water was available from a jug at meal times and you could buy additional bottles.The infinity pool had great views and the outdoor seating areas were lovely. We would have liked more information about the full board package. Even after we booked this wasn't available, leading to a disappointing start when told we were only able to eat in the buffet restaurant. ",Negative
"This is really a unique hotel. The facilities are really good, and the staff were always extremely polite and really helpful. Food was good every time it was ordered, either from the buffet, a la carte or to the room. The hotel has three pools, two are really decorative (an infinity pool and a natural rock pool) and the other is a really good pool for splashing around and playing in.The thing that sets the hotel apart though is the way it's built into the jungle. This means the hotel is teeming with natural wildlife. Whether it was monitor lizards strolling along the corridors, monkeys drinking from the pool, bats flying around reception at dusk or countless birds flying overhead, the sense of being close to the jungle is tangible. I would definitely recommend the hotel on its own merit, but it is also only a 30 min drive from Sigiriya, so it makes a perfect base to visit this epic monument. This was my second visit after going in 2007, and although the hotel had changed a fair bit, it was still a joy. One final note, it was busy - especially at dinner time. Check beforehand the busiest buffet times and avoid them, or at least be prepared to wait. If you do have to wait, the lounge barman was excellent and I can recommend the Mojito and the Cosmopolitan!!!",Positive
"The arrival was not awe inspiring, indeed the hotel looked a little industrial to me. The hotel is on two wings form the central reception and is 1km long with views over the adjoining lake and in the distance Sigiriya, superb location. AVOID rooms between ending 41-44 as these are in the Dambulla wing and face the rear hillside. We were in room 544 in the Dambulla wing (DOH!). This is a superior room that honestly is showing its age, with free wi-fi, but you are provided with individual log-ins. There are no robes or slippers. The bed is made up of two single beds. Has the usual facilities including the 4 digit safe, T&C and chargeable mini-bar. As this was a special birthday for my Queen, I asked if we could move rooms to one with a view, but there was no space. The hotel did however send my wife a birthday cake! Toiletries are of the refillable types, that's annoying, but superb smelling body wash. The shower is very odd. Full clear pane of glass, so you can out everything on show, or pull down a canvas blind, that is showing a lot of mould, as it would!! Needs to replace the glass with partial obscured, so you can have the view without scaring the locals! A warning, I opened our door to take a picture and almost immediately a monkey appeared for feeding. I had to shut the door quickly to avoid it going into the room. Gave me such a sad stare, but you cannot feed them. The food is good, again buffet for us, with additional services provided outside - BBQ, pancakes etc. Good breakfast selection. There are three pools, but the star is the infinity that has a great view of Sigiriya. Superb. Now the glass story. We went out for the day and returned. I sat by the pool whilst my wife went to get changed. She was ages, and when she returned told me that our patio door had been shattered. This was not safety glass, it was in very large pieces. Apparently this happens a lot, a monkey had forced a chair through the window. The pane of glass was fully replaced within about 50 minutes, they had glass cut to size on site, so this is a regular occurrence. The spa is excellent. I had a 30 minute back, neck and shoulders massage - 5,000 rupees (£25/$32.5), brilliant. My wife had a 90 minute hot stones, which she said was the best massage she has ever had - 12,600 rupees (£63/$82). I definitely recommend this especially after the strains of Sigiriya rock. All staff were excellent, Chamara in the bar is a very lovely man and Inshaf was a very helpful cashier. All in all a nice stay, but could have been better with a nicer room. Highly recommended.",Positive
"From the moment we arrived we were very excited to be in this hotel. The setting is just stunning, and the views of Sigiriya, the lake and elephants are so special. The architecture and design of the hotel is fascinating and there is a lot to take in whether you are in a restaurant or in a corridor. It is an incredible building. However don't expect the bedroom to match up to expectations...our room was clean (except the bath) but it was all a little bit tired and in need of refurbishment. It feels a bit like stepping back in time, but with all the wear and tear plain to see. Hopefully they have a plan! The staff were wonderful. Everyone was so friendly and helpful and we really enjoyed our stay. The views from the top pool are incredible - some guests were put off thinking the pool water was dirty but its built into the rock which is why it doesn't have light blue water! This is a magical spot. The monkeys on the balcony were hilarious. I was grateful for the warnings to keep doors shut etc. Overall we had a fabulous experience which could only be improved by a cleaner less tired bathroom.",Positive
We loved the hotel. It is absolutely beautiful walking around with the jungle engulfing the structure. The infinity pool looking out over Dambulla lake is awesome. The hotel just needs to step up the service side of things. 40 minutes waiting for a drink at the bar and no luggage storage for guests arriving early was a bit of a bad first impression. The rooms however are amazing and with a little bit of work this place could be something really special.,Positive
"A masterpiece of Bawa (A famous Sri Lankan Architect), on the outskirts of Dambulla, overlooking Sigiriya Rock. Dramatized entrance. The atmosphere is sensual. Found the facilities to be very good. Would recommend to anyone.",Positive
We just spent 3 nights at this hotel. The hotel is rather dated and tired but this is made up by the services and staff. We got a room upgrade to a room with a jacuzzi which was fun and we loved watching the monkeys play on the balcony each morning. I would definitely recommend staying in this unusual hotel. It is close to Sigiriya and Dambulla temple and 1 hour from National park. We had a lovely experience. Thank you,Positive
Gorgeous setting - cant beat monkeys on the window sills in the morning. Close to Sigiriya and the Dambulla rock temple - both major attractions. Amazing buffets with best vattalapam I had in Sri Lanka. Place could probably do with a refurbishment - towels could do with replacing. Warning - we had a jacuzzi in our bathroom which sounds (and was) great except that the shower was in it and climbing in and out a major hazard especially as the floor floods with water when the doors are opened.,Positive
"This is a nice hotel in which to stay. We were very lucky that they upgraded us to a room on the 7th floor which was huge and had great views of the lake. The only thing to note is that the hotel is a 20-30 minute drive from Dambulla, so if you don't want to eat in the hotel it is a fair drive to make. We also had a problem with the power going out intermittently in our room...which meant we had to jiggle the key to get it to go again. It wasn't a major problem. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.",Positive
"We were attracted by the architecture and ""eco"" feel of this hotel and we were not disappointed. Large well designed rooms and one of the best bathrooms and showers I have encountered anywhere. Monkeys on your balcony in the mornings was a treat. A few minor downsides.The area around the infinity pool needs a bit of refurbishment. The service, although very earnest, is a bit slow. The hotel is a long way from any other habitation and side trips take quite a while. We were disappointed with the food- the only bad fish curry I experienced on the trip. Overall a charming hotel and we are glad we stayed there.",Positive
"My wife and I stayed for 2 nights and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The hotel is beautifully designed and laid out, an outstanding example of Architect Geoffrey Bawa's work. The service and food quality is very good, befitting of such a high quality hotel.",Positive
"This hotel is known to the world for many exciting facts and it is truly a hidden gem in the jungle . Great to mingle with the nature and experience that isolation you always want to have . Hopped in recently and was offered 30% discount on BB . We were given a room on a ground level. It consists of very hazardous cupboards , the bathroom was totally uncleaned and disgusting . Unemployed bins with previous guests litter in it . I question the quality of the table water bottles and the amenities . So does the towels , torn and old looking . AC did not work and it was noisy right through the night . May be we were offered a room in a lowest category . I did not check at the time of the checking in . Food is average and we had our breakfast take away . That was just plain . bland cheese and tomato sandwiches . Place has made a name for the location and amazing architecture and it is an unfortunate that we did not experience the five star level .",Negative
Hidden hotel' with great views! This is a perfect hotel for visiting Sigiriya. The breakfast was very nice and the room quite spacious. Just watch out for the monkeys trying to get in from the windows :),Positive
We stayed here for 5nights. The staff are lovely and the food excellent. We love Sri Lankan food. Breakfasts were delicious with lots of wonderfully tasty treats. We loved the range of curries and there was plenty of western food too. There were 4 chefs on the balcony available to make omelettes and egg hoppers. In the evening We ate mostly in the a la carte restaurant as it was quieter and cheaper than the buffet if you don't want 3 courses. Be careful of the monkeys who watch what's going on. We had a banana on the desk in our room. I opened the window to let fresh air in and almost immediately a monkey came in and took the banana!! It was a bit shocking but we didn't have any other visits as we made sure there was no food in the room! The views from the hotel are spectacular. A great place to base yourself in order to see all the amazing sights in the area.,Positive
"An exquisite property, built in to a rock, and roughly 1 km from one side of the property to the other. 3 pools, excellent buffet dinner, and wonderful service. I only gave it a 4 because the rooms are a bit tired. Although the resort is a 5-star, and the spa is incredible, the bathrooms in the rooms can be updated, and they need to figure out how to keep the A/C on all the time -- it turns off when you remove your key. It's a great location for Dambulla cave, Sigiriya, Minneria or Pollunaruwa day trips.",Positive
"The location and design of this hotel is amazing.The ambition it has to blend with its natural surroundings is wholly achieved and the monkeys, birds and other wildlife will remind you of that on a daily basis. So, ignore the 23 year old fittings (which anyway are all still in working order), and you will experience a fascinating and very different hotel stay. And be sure to have a massage at the Six Senses Spa located within the hotel and ask for Santoshi. She is brilliant.",Positive
"Visited with my family and needless to say, it was a prefect stay in a calm and an isolated place. Built in the midst of a jungle surrounded by rocks and trees, the hotel offers you perfect serenity. Of course, need to make a special mention of the meals, which were superb with a great variety and deliciousness. The staff are really kind and attentive. I would say the rooms (We stayed at Dambulla wing) may need a small touch of renovation, but all in all nothing to bother! Great hotel, Great stay!!",Positive
"This amazing hotel is off the beaten track, fully embedded in its surrounding nature. Overall, good hotel with beautiful rooms and views. And although at first sight, the hotel is good maintained, a second look is worth it. It lacked detail here and there.We did appreciated the free water and strong wifi through the resort. The infinity pool was stunning. We would have loved to relax there. But there were hardly any loungers for this big hotel. So we had to go to the other pool which completely lacked attention. It was really disappointing. Overall, buffet was good and everything else. But somehow this beautiful place lacked personality. It was all very anonymous and we never felt very comfortable or very welcome. I would choose a different hotel next time.Note: Be aware of the monkeys!",Negative
"we were checked in with a drink by the pool after walking through the half-rock-half-de building foyer.monkeys provided a diversion (don't let them get into your room !!) there are 3 pools. the infinity pool in the main area affords spectacular views over the lake (which looks man made to me) nevertheless a peaceful and beautiful setting for an hotel. food and drinks all fine. the ""rock"" was actually a secondary experience",Positive
"The longest hotel I ever been , hotel includes everything right,located in right place covered with trees and rocks,professional trained staff and helpful. Special Thanks sujeewa for special arrangements",Positive
"While the view and location are breathtaking, the overall service and F&B that you find at the hotel are very average-like - staff tries to rush into everything and makes things a bit uncomfortable, and Food was a disappointment",Positive
"Amazingly beautiful and relaxing hotel in the heart of the cultural triangle. The infinity pool looking over the lake is a real highlight. The buffet dinner is definitely overpriced (LKR7000 pp) for what it is, but it caters to a huge range of cuisines. I was traveling with a mate and we shared a room, which turned out to be pretty affordable at around USD 100 a night. The pool and views alone are worth the visit.",Positive
"Beautiful views and great concept, this hotel is nested in the middle of the Sri Lankan jungle and very open to the nature around. Rooms are basic but nice, you feel like you are in a lodge. Staff is helpful. Pleasant and convenient place to stay with lots to visit around including the Sigyria rock.",Positive
On arriving at the hotel I was greeted with a flower and some fresh juice which was lovely. Checkin took a while and the staff didn't seem to know what they were doing. The hotel itself is magnificent and our panoramic room was fantastic. We regularly had monkeys visiting our balcony (ensuring the doors were locked at all times) which was delightful. A true piece of paradise. The infinity pool should have been a relaxing and tranquil retreat after we had been out exploring all day but instead it was overrun with children splashing about and jumping in - not what we expected from the photographs. Maybe the hotel could allocate one of the pools as adults only to allow those on a romantic break the chance to relax in peace. The breakfast was lovely and we ate in the a la Carte restaurant both nights having the traditional curries which were splendid and some of the best we had in Sri Lanka. Our driver advised that his accommodation was suitable too. The thing that lets this hotel down is the service - it seems like half of the staff didn't know what they were doing and we found out that the turnover is high. Overall I would recommend this hotel itself but would suggest that the levels of service are looked at for this supposed luxury hotel.,Positive
"Stayed for 3 nights on the seventh floor. We wanted good views of the lake and we weren't disappointed. This is a large hotel consequently be prepared for long distance walks to the central lobby and restaurant locations. The hotel facilities are fairly sparse and although there are 3 pools, the lounges are few and far between. Service around the bar/pool area is poor however the staff are all friendly and helpful. Breakfast is excellent with a good selection of meals to suit all tastes. Because the location of the hotel is reasonably remote & within a national park there is no opportunity to explore the immediate vicinity outside the hotel itself. There are some shops near the lobby but they appeared to be closed during the time of our visit.",Positive
"A lovely located Hotel in a National Park on the banks of a large Lake. Stayed three nights and enjoyed a lovely room in the new wing overlooking the Lake. The Hotel has three pools, with an infinity pool the highlight. Staff were very friendly and helpful while the restaurants and food very good. Situated close to some major attractions like the Sigiriya Rock Fortress.",Positive
"We stayed here for 3 nights recently. The location is lovely, away from the not so pretty town of Dambulla but a good base to see the cultural triangle from. The hotel is very unique in its setting. The staff were lovely, very pleasant. We stayed in the sigiriya wing, on the fourth floor. This was a very central location in the quite large hotel. we opted for a larger room, with a jacuzzi bath, as we were enjoying our honeymoon. The bedroom itself was a disappointment. Dark and dated we felt. The shower was over the jacuzzi bath, and had no shower curtail so the bathroom got soaked every time we showered. Unfortunately you could notice the ongoing issue with this with limescale in many spots in the bathroom. Otherwise, it was perfectly clean. The food is absolutely outstanding. We opted for half board and were delighted we did. Huge selection of food, highest quality. Hats off to the excellent chefs. We enjoyed our stay here, and would recommend it as a place to stay, but it would be nice to see the bedrooms reach their full potential.",Positive
"The architectural beauty was way ahead of its time and still continues to enthrall guests. Built along a mountainside, the green foliaged building blends seamlessly into its natural environment and feels like a tree house inside a forest....with monkeys!",Positive
"Geoffrey Bawa designed this amazing resort hotel in the middle of a jungle, overlooking a lake, that blends in perfectly with the surroundings. It's Indoor/outdoor design makes you feel like you're in nature without actually being in nature. Room number 507 was the architect's favorite because it provides beautiful views of the surrounding landscape, and a hot tub from which to enjoy those views. As in EVERY Shri Lankan hotel was stayed in, the staff was extremely courteous and efficient, but because we came from a boutique hotel this place felt a little bit ""Resorty""--the only reason I'd give it four stars instead of five. The food is good and varied, and the hotel itself is perfectly situated for visits to the cultural triangle",Positive
We had two amazing nights at the Heritance Kandalama. On the edge of a lake with the forest behind it's a great location to visit Sigiriya and Dambula. Try and get a room on the top floor as they come with the most incredible views of the lake. Perfect for a sunset photo cloud cover permitting. Like most hotels in Sri Lanka the restaurant was buffet style. The staff were super friendly.,Positive
"This is a Spence Aitken property which operates a number of hotels in Sri Lanka. My observations: Location: I loved the location. Beautifully set mountainside, it's surrounded by thick woods inhabited by birds and monkeys. It is lakeside and the infinity pool butts up the lake. The common areas have a great vantage point to enjoy the surroundings. Physical Plant: Designed by Geoffery Bawa, it is unlike most modern hotels. Disappointingly, unlike most modern properties it is not equipped with basic amenities like convenient power sockets and light switches. It does have wi-fi and at good speed. The rooms are clean comfortable but are starting to show age. Service: Service in the dining area at breakfast the first day was atrocious. Similarly in the lounge by the pool inattentive staff seemed to be the order of the day. I complained to the manager on duty. From there on I was taken care of quite well. Food: As a half board guest, I had breakfast and dinner buffets daily during my 3 day stay. Both breakfast and dinner had a large selection of items. Aesthetically very pleasing to the eye but mediocre at best in taste. Overall: This is at best a 4 star hotel.",Negative
"Overall we really enjoyed our stay. Lovely infinity pool, monkeys on the balcony every morning. Quiet and beautiful views from our room even from our shower room. The food was as good as the other places we stayed in Sri Lanka. The european style food only average and the curries which was very good and tasty were nearly always cold. This hotel seems to cater mainly for large groups, this meant that on each occasion when the 2 of us went down for dinner, we were turned away and told to come back later, whilst there were vast empty tables for groups to arrive when they felt like it and they were never fully occupied.",Positive
"We stayed here for 3 nights as part of a Sri Lanka tour and had an excellent stay, although I'm unable to give this hotel the highest grade - read on. Built into the rocks and cliff side and designed by Geoffrey Bawa, the architecture is stunning. The open reception desk oozes charm and the greeting is warm and efficient. We had an upgraded room (Panoramic Room I think - there are bigger ones on 7th floor) on 6th floor overlooking the lake and it was comfortable and well equipped. There are 3 pools although we only swam in one. The ones on the roof and in front of the bar looked wonderful but were a bit of a trek from our room and time was limited. We used the one on the second floor and it was fine. This is a large hotel with what appeared to be a rapid turnover and a bit of a coach party / conference / wedding clientele. This means that there's a bit of a pack mentality dependant on the culture of the group. It also means that you get large groups in the restaurants and the bars didn't appear to get much trade. For me, catering was disappointing. There are no alternative places to buy food in the area so the hotel has a captive audience. The choices are the main, buffet restaurant where buffet evening meals and breakfast are taken, the a la carte and a snack bar. The buffet lacked any form of atmosphere and the price was very high, particularly if you didn't want to eat too much. The food's fine and the choice good but I found it far too busy and far too noisy - a very expensive works canteen! On our final night we had a one course meal of decent curry in the 'booking only' A La Carte restaurant and it was very good, although they were a little surprised that we didn't want starter, main course & dessert. It came in at about half the price of the buffet! Top tip - if you're not too hungry, take the trouble to book the a la carte and just have one course. Alcohol's grossly overpriced, as are other drinks - just have the water from the jug. We bought some beer at the local beer shop on the way back to the hotel, cooled it in the fridge and had it on the balcony. The hotel charged 4 times the price.",Negative
"You have to drive almost 4.5 hrs to hotel and last two kilometers road was terrible. hotel is like oasis. design of the hotel makes you unforgettable view and rooms are huge,excellent and clean. Very helpful and hospitality staff available to serve anytime. Verity of foods and amazing catering. if you willing to spend for hotel, i must say its worth and you must visit kandalama even once. you have to be careful from monkeys and must keep windows close. they are like train to stolen the things. Gym spa and wifi and all facility available inside the hotel. Pool was awesome experience and pool view was unforgettable. But at night you have to be careful from serpents.",Positive
"The hotel was built into the surrounding rocks with a curving corridor that fitted around a large rock outcrop. There was an 'infinity poo;' that overlooked serene lakes, ancient large rocks and rugged hills. The hotel security was very reassuring and this is the only hotel built in this location of lakes and natural forest. The jungle trek guide, Sanath, was meticulously helpful, pleasant and expertly informative about the plants and animals. The early morning boat-ride on the lake allowed us to see the birds, morning mist. The elephant Monica greeted us with a touch of her trunk and profound gaze. The front office staff could benefit from some training and improvement to check-in and check-out service. , However Shantha was exceptionally hospitable. The meals were a tasty combination of local and international cuisines. The rooms offered a splendid (breath-taking) view of the mountains and golden statue of Buddha.",Positive
" arrived here with my husband for 3 nights. Greeted with drinks and cool towels, our room was ready but we also did arrive pretty late 6pm. The hotel and the grounds are nice, the buffet had different options, all very good. Our room was a luxury room, spacious room and bathroom, with a comfy bed. The hotel is pretty big and located in a remote path off the road. Not that many guests, nothing to do at night. The wifi was weak and the electricity went off from time to time for about 5 seconds, one time I was in the elevator alone during those 5 seconds and that wasnt fun. The pool is nice, not many chairs but great views and deep. Employees were accommodating and friendly. Overall we had a good 3 nights but I think I would try another hotel next time I am in town.",Negative
"The location provides a unique stay in a natural environment. The staff were very attentive and the food choices at breakfast and buffet dinner excellent. Rooms are well appointed, our bath/shower occupying a great view over the lake. There are three pools on different floors and all worth trying. Entertainment in the evening was variable, sometimes quirky and never well supported. The monkeys living in the forest underneath will happily climb in from your balcony so heed the advice and don't open the patio doors",Positive
"We spent 3 nights here at the beginning on March 2017 for our 40th wedding anniversary. The hotel is set on Lake Kandellama with lovely views. on arrival we were greeted with a cocktail drink of local fruit. The hotel is one of the few upscale properties in this region of Sri Lanka. The rooms (whilst a little tired) are highly functional with great air conditioning and a fab shower with a glass wall overlooking the jungle. Dont expect 'Haute Cusinie' and you wont be disappointed. Overall great value for money and lovely staff. Dont put up with pretentious honeymooners expecting a boutique hotel and abusing the staff, who really dont deserve it and are trying very hard!",Positive
"Ideally situated on hillside overlooking a lake this hotel was built to minimise the impact on the surrounding area. A good drive from the main road it was very quiet with spectacular views and plenty of local wildlife, being in the heart of elephant country. The rooms were traditionally furnished with all the necessary equipment/facilities although a little dark.",Positive
"After a drive up an un-made track to reach this hotel, it's not until you arrive and enter that you realise how stunning the location is. It's almost like it's been carved out of the hillside, the views from the open air walkways and the rooms themselves are simply spectacular. The view from our double aspect room was probably the best we have ever had, not just in Sri Lanka, but across the world. Food quality was a tad disappointing in the main restaurant and wifi was particularly poor here. Staff service was excellent throughout the hotel",Positive
"Great value overall for what you pay. The buffet dinner looks unappealing at first but was fantastic and really good quality. The service is efficient and thorough. The rooms/hotel may need some updating overall but still quite an impressive setting. The pools are small and there's often no room. The road up to hotel is painfully rustic but that's part of the experience. The spa is stand out excellent. Great value and recommend using it. Great food, service, views, setting - so overall a good deal",Positive
"Friendly and attentive customer service in this large hotel. The corridors are long and the staircases not always connected to all floors so somewhat confusing but once you find your way, it is ok. The infinity pool is small but beautiful although next to a bar which is a bit odd. The restaurants are offering decent enough food but nothing spectacular. The rooms are spacious and functional and so are the bathrooms. Overall a nice experience although not convenient if you want to leave the hotel to explore the area as you need transport and also the size of the hotel and corridors is to a detriment to its charm",Positive
"We visited this hotel specifically to experience first hand one of Geoffrey Bawa's architectural wonders. Set in a stunning jungle location, with a view to Sigiriya across from Amaya Lake, the hotel is nestled directly into the actual rock face. The infinity pool location and view is stunning. I was impressed with the buffet which offered a varied selection of Asian and some Western dishes. The manager of this section was friendly, helpful and open to receiving feedback. Our room was spacious and clean, renovated to accommodate A/C. Although each room comes with its own balcony, you are warned to not eat outside as the opportunistic monkey troupe patrols the vast railing 'highway'. We did enjoy watching them stream past but from behind the sanctity of the sliding doors! On the other hand, I was disappointed both with the reception and checkout staff. The attitude was dismissive. We would have been disappointed if this had been our initiation to Sri Lankan hospitality! Some in-house training would certainly help to lighten up the somber and bored attitude of front-line staff.",Positive
"This was a great hotel. Very pretty with good service. The pool area was great, we never had an issue getting chairs at any point in the day. It was crowded with tourists, especially those that loved to take selfies which can be annoying. We ate breakfast in the restaurant with a buffet which had a lot of options, but had dinners in the a la cart restaurant. The food was usually overcooked and expensive, but fine considering we are in Sri Lanka. Our room was on the 5th floor near the bar which was very annoying and loud late at night and early in the morning. We did use the spa during our trip and it was alright. I'd avoid the massage, but had a great facial.",Positive
"We stayed at this place because of Geoffrey Bawa's reputation. In many ways, the reputation is deserved. This hotel is designed to wrap around a granite monolith and looks out onto a manmade reservoir. The view is beautiful and tranquil and the hotel has lots of wide long spaces. Very elegant. The cost for the room surprised us at first but when you factor in all three meals and accomodation for our driver, it is actually very reasonable for this standard of hotel. The food is mainly buffet-style(although there is an a-la-carte restaurant we didn't try) and is of a very high standard. One drawback is that the facilities are getting dated and significant investment needs to go in to restore the hotel to its full glory.",Positive
"Well disguised eco hotel, with plants growing all over the front to make it blend in with the surrounding area. There are 3 pools, one of which has the rock as a base, but there are hardly and loungers or areas to sit by the pools. It rained when we were there but, if it hadn't we would have struggled to find outside space. The hall ways are open so bats fly along them at night. There are lots of monkeys around so don't be surprised to see one outside your window. Rooms are lovely with bathrooms overlooking the lake. The buffet meal at night was awful. the beef was inedible and most of the food cold. The hotel was full so we felt as though we were in a school canteen. We therefore ate in the a la carte restaurant the 2nd night [ discount for half board clients]. The food here was delicious. This is a very expensive hotel and I don't think value for money.",Negative
We enjoyed our 4 night stay here. The hotel is in a beautiful location overlooking the lake. The room was spacious with a decent sized bathroom. It was quite difficult to get in and out of the bath/shower and the blinds at the window were very mouldy which was a little unpleasant. Food in the main buffet restaurant was good although the restaurant was a little crowded. The hotel had three nice pools but at two of them there were only a handful of sunbeds so when you came back from a day sightseeing there often wasn't a bed despite there being plenty of space. I heard other guests commenting on this - I think the hotel should take note. Finally if you do use this as a base for sightseeing you should be aware that it does take quite a while to get to Sigiriya and Polonnaruwa.,Negative
We started for 3 days at this hotel. As other reviewers have mentioned the hotel is deceptively very large. We stayed as a family in the deluxe rooms on the 5th floor so had views of the lake and the sigiriya rock towards the evening. (In the morning the rock is covered by mist!) The rooms were spacious but a bit dated and needs sprucing up! Wifi was slow and would spontaneously drop in certain areas! The food was terrific. And the staff at the restaurant made every effort to see we were catered to! There are 3 pools. The weather was a but gloomy so we only tried the infinity pool. The views are simply amazing.,Positive
"Our first stop during our trip to Sri Lanka my wife & I thoroughly enjoyed our stay, staff always greeting you with a smile & are ready to assist you. The food was great, freshly prepared by chefs (hoppers, roti, BBQ even).",Positive
"Its a very good experience. The infinity pool designed by Sri Lanka’s famed architect, Geoffrey Bawa, which blends in seamlessly with the Kandalama Lake is amazing. A perfect vacation spot, though its expensive.",Positive
I had heard of this hotel but this was my first visit. Ambiance is so relaxing. Hotel has nicely blended to the environment. We had a warm welcome with personal attention. It has special dining experiences with Sri Lankan cultural events.Food was good but impressive.,Positive
"The three most impressive things about the hotel are its architecture, food and views. The view from any place in the hotel was gorgeous. For both breakfast and dinner I could have exploded for the sheer variety and deliciousness of the food.",Positive
"This hotel has a fantastic location with views of the Lake with a vast array of flora & fauna which included some cheeky monkeys. The buffet style dining was good as was our visit to the a la carte restaurant. Our friends were very taken with their massage at the Spa. Although there were 3 pools, the main infinity pool overlooking the Lake was a tad small with insufficient recliners to meet demand. Staff were excellent",Positive
"The only reason that this doesn't make my 5 stars is that the rooms in particular are looking rather tired and could do with a spruce up. Appreciate that they still need to retain the 'green' styling. We were also at the Dambulla end of this kilometre venue and on the 3rd floor could see nothing of the view shown on the hotel's website. Rooms were large and comfortable but in the evening they definitely needed more lighting. Great shower! We ate in both the buffet restaurant and the Kaludiya on the top floor (twice) - loved the fish up there and definitely more romantic than the buffet 'fight'. Breakfasts in the main dining room was an excellent spread and very international, so you can get your full English. There are 3 pools, but if you want a swim then go to the one at the Dambulla end (4th floor). You might find that the monkeys come for a game of water=polo with you. A definite must is to keep your room doors shut - the monkeys will be in after your goodies in an instant! Full marks to a friendly helpful staff.",Positive
The Kandalama has a stunning setting built into the rock and surrounding hillside. The room was perhaps a little basic / worn but had a superb view out to Sigiriya. Staff were very friendly and we enjoyed relaxing at the bar. The dining room felt a bit 'school dinners' in particular due to some of the large groups.,Positive
"This lovely hotel is nestled in the middle of a luscious forest and overlooks the lake. The views are spectacular. The service is superb and everyone is friendly. The shops are overly priced. As for the room, the bed is awkwardly placed next to the door. The door knob is placed too close to the door border; I shut the door on my wedding ring because of that. The room is not well lit if there's no sunlight. The shower door does not close properly resulting in a puddle of water in the bathroom. The toilet flush is in really bad condition and needs to either be changed or extensively cleaned. The coasters in the room, were clearly not new. Any bang or slam or laughter can be easily heard from people in the hallway or the neighbors. There was a stain on the pillow. The terrace cafe has a lovely view of the lake and infinity pool. The live music in the evening was wonderful. I enjoyed watching wildlife around the hotel, especially the birds.",Negative
"This hotel was designed by to fit into the countryside, and it does this very well, from outside you mainly just see jungle creepers! You really feel part of the scenery. Monkey look in through your windows (so keep them shut if your not in your room). Large suite (lounge area, bedroom and bathroom) but do take mosquito repellant, being part of the jungle does have its drawbacks. Excellent base for exploring the cultural triangle, but also great to be able to relax in any of the 3 pools, gymnasium or spa. Views of the lake and Sigiriya are to had fro all rooms as the hotels is spread sideways with rooms all at the front.",Positive
"Your pay for the view, architecture and jungle but the hotel needs much more attention to detail. Food is extortionate in price but not exceptional in taste and given you have very limited choices in where to eat can be frustrating. We found our best and cheapest meal was actually room service. Agree with another review here that more could be made of the bar/lounge/pool areas. As they lack atmosphere, service and they felt redundant. The pools were beautiful but also lacked any shade or service and felt very much on display to bus loads of tourists and guests. The rooms and views were amazing. Loved the glass shower with panoramic views. The spa was also a highlight with amazing massages however we continued to get touted for more massages by the very people that had massaged us. At this price I'd expect a bit more attention to detail, service and looking after the guests.",Negative
"In its heyday this hotel would have been fantastic. Sadly it's a bit tired and very expensive for what you get. Notwithstanding this the setting is lovely, monkeys are crazy thanks to people who feed them. Staff are lovely and food is great but wildly expensive. This booking was our 3rd and last booking with Agoda. We booked as a family of 4 and somehow Agoda changed this to 1 adult. Agoda advertise the king room as having a king and 2 twin beds when in effect the rooms are only 25sqm and there is no way a family of 4 could fit in. The end result is that we had to purchase another room for the kids and cop nearly $700 USD in additional costs. We will NEVER use Agoda again. Impossible to think that such an organisation can stuff up 2 out of the 3 bookings we made and be so unprofessional in resolving it.",Negative
Kandalama hotel is located at in front of the kandalama lake. IIt is amezing place in the evening time. Good food and good hospitality. Some time can see lot of wild animals. It is one great plan by Geoffrey bawa's.,Positive
"Very interesting hotel built abutting a huge rock, up a bit so you have a great view on the lake and valley surrounding the hotel. As other writers have said, Sri Lankans like to recommend this hotel as it is unusual. Service is very good, as is the buffet. Excellent spa. Our daughter loved seeing a friendly chipmunk peek its head on the terrace table waiting for some morsels. Overall a very good hotel.",Positive
"This hotel is wonderfully located, no doubt about this. The view overlooking the lake and towards the Sigiriya rock is breath taking, especially at dusk. However, it is a massive hotel, with a very large number of rooms, with large coaches unloading herds of tourists. Do not expect a quiet place, especially during breakfast and dinner.",Positive
"I am partial to boutique hotels, hence the four instead of a five. That said, this is a beautiful hotel. The location is gorgeous, and it has stunning views. There are monkeys in the jungle just outside the property. Some are shy and stay in the jungle, others will step on your balcony and forage for food. They add to the charm of the place. The property is situated on a beautiful lake, and it's enjoyable to walk in that area in the evening. The food is served buffet style. They have something to appeal to every taste.",Positive
"This was a good hotel with decent facilities, good food and excellent service. The views were great and the hotel had loads of resident cheeky monkeys, do not feed as you will not get rid..... The infinity pool was relatively basic however a welcome treat after a long day of traveling. The food was pretty good, we had the half board Buffett, it was probably one of the better buffets experienced on our trip.",Positive
his hotel is nested into a cave. Amazing views all around. Had a fantastic time here - be warned there are a lot of monkeys that grace the balconys so if you aren't prepared for wildlife don't stay here. Don't feed them and they won't bother you. Staff were friendly but language can be an issue and on Sri Lankan time so order food early. Buffet breakfast and dinner lovely. Had dinner one night at other resteraunt and was slow - difficult when you have little kids. Pool was amazing but watch little ones as it's deep. Rooms clean and facilities very good.,Positive
"This is a wonderful eco hotel in a beautiful jungle setting 4 hours drive from Colombo. Situated right on the lake with views over the lake and into the jungle. Great position for sight seeing - Dambulla, Elephant safari, Sigiriya etc. If you like nature then this is the place we saw 2 different types of monkeys, bats, giant squirrels, a mongoose and lots of different birds. Yes there are lots of bugs around but it's the jungle what do you expect? Just be sure to wear insect repellant especially in the evenings. Rooms were very spacious but could do with brightening up as they are very dark. The bathroom was lovely. The buffet in the evenings and for breakfast was very good with a great range of Sri Lankan food and other dishes. Particularly enjoyed the BBQ night with fresh sea food. There is also a snack restaurant near the infinity pool. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Would definitely visit again.",Positive
"This is a piece of art, intelligently blended with the surroundings of trees, animals, rocky mountains and the lake. The infinity pool has an amazing view, though the view from the chillout area, buffet area and rooms does not second to it. Dinner is arranged in the balcony outside with lamps which is really gorgeous. Also not to mention the tasty choices of food. I wish they would make the Tv in the room a bit bigger and place it in a proper area, though again who goes there to watch Tv. I really want to mention the Classical music group. They does a pretty amazing job in attracting the crowd. Good job folks. It was a worth experience to have.",Positive
"A great place to set up to explore the surrounding area. It is a 'resort' though so very big, three pools, huge buffet, slightly removed from a pure Sri Lankan experience. However it's peaceful with amazing views, monkeys climbing the trees around you. The views at the breakfast buffet were stunning, as was the food on offer which was pretty much anything you can think of. The rooms are comfortable but perhaps just on the verge of getting tired, we had a very leaky shower but it was all glass looking at the lake and trees which was beautiful. The staff were friendly and helpful. We tried the ala carte restaurant and ordered the only two Sri Lankan dishes on offer which were both fantastic. I also had a spa treatment which was excellent. And we had one of the pools to ourselves which was pretty special. The decor was fab, minimalist. One weird and annoying thing was the slow, elevator Christmas music that was on a constant loop. Overall it's a lovely stay and in particular if you are missing western food, and that resort style type of hotel- it will certainly have what you need!",Positive
"We stayed in Heritance Kandalama for 3 nights in a deluxe room on the 5th floor. The view from our room was absolutely stunning. We had a big jacuzzi bath and a very comfortable bed. Only two small water bottles were provided daily. The breakfast buffet was fantastic with a choice of freshly cooked Sri Lankan hoppers, currys as well as a wide choice of western dishes. What we did not like was the service level as it was nowhere near to 5 star. For example, we asked the reception whether any other guests enquired regarding day trips or car and driver hire for a day to visit the local highlights like Sigiriya or Kaudulla National Park. We thought they could help to set a combine trip for 2-3 couples to share the cost etc., but we were just told NO. I asked for yoga classes, and was again told NO. There was no effort to help us nor support... Eventually we organised everything ourselves.",Negative
We stayed only very short but was worth it. You are in the middle of nature. Very comfi rooms and big baths. The food was very good too although buffet. We were happy to have some variety after snacking all day. Service was OK. A bit slow though but they are friendly. The location is amazing. I was a bit disappointed as I tried to book the breakfast on the barge through their website and they told me the lake is dry!!! When we arrived a month later I saw it was no where near to be dry and our driver told us it never dries.,Positive
"Arrival and check-in was fine and quick, although a bus with Chinese Tourists just arrived at the same time. The hotel is quite dark and minimalistic. Long corridors that are open to the outside (no windows). So in the evening a lot of insects are around in the open space areas. 2 restaurants and one bar. Food is ok, but nothing exciting. Spa and massage was great although were are not experts in that field. Service was good and friendly. Rooms (we had a suite on the 5th floor) were nice and clean (although need refurbishment soon). In my opinion the whole hotel lacks a cozy atmosphere. We felt a bit trapped in the jungle in a dark industrial complex with no nice place to hang out and relax. And with kids there is nothing to do in the hotel apart from the pool (there is a place called Eco Park about 1 km away from the hotel but no playground). I rated very good, because if you know what you are getting into it is very good. But we didn't expect it to be this way. The apes were fun and coming from Dubai we didn't find it expensive (20 USD for a big steak was the most expensive dish in the a la card restaurant). Most people stay 1-2 days which is fine on the way through the country. I think there would be more potential.",Negative
"Great welcome after a long journey. Amazing views from our suite. Very average food. High volume dining with limited choice and poor quality food. Dinner on first night saw sweet and sour fish where the fish and calamari was so hard I couldn't bite it. Breakfast ok but nowhere near as good as the Tranz Cinnamon where the food is far superior and only a four star. Rooms need a good clean and spruce up,looking well used and a bit tired. All in all a lovely place but let down by the food.",Negative
"The hotel trades on the fact that it was designed by the famous Sri Lankan architect Geoffrey Bawa. Unfortunately, he was going through his 'brute concrete' period at the time, so that it all looks rather 1960-ish (although built much later). That aside, the setting is splendid and for many of us, having a troop of monkeys staring in through the bathroom window as we showered was something of a first. The rooms are large but curiously designed: it's unusual to open a wardrobe door to find your wife having a toilet break on the other side (not some unfortunate misunderstanding on her part: the wardrobe also opened into the bathroom and she'd omitted to close that side's door). Allow about a week to come to terms with the complexities of the lighting and fan controls (hint: there's a hidden panel behind the bedhead. Once you discover this, life becomes easier). The hotel seems to be having a bit of an identity crisis: it's not sure whether it's an up-market establishment or a mass tourist destination, and as a result it sometimes falls between two stools. A tidal wave of noisy Chinese visitors will overwhelm the main restaurant area or the 'infinity' pool, but the hotel will not allow tuk-tuks to pick up customers from the entrance, thus effectively holding guests ransom to the exorbitant prices charged by the hotel's food outlets. The food in both the 'mass' and 'select' restaurants, it should be noted, though expensive is really excellent (as indeed the cost dictates). I suspect that many of the rave reviews this hotel receives are posted by people who have never been to a similar establishment anywhere else and for whom it was thus a unique experience. Frankly, I think you might find better value for money in somewhere like Habarana.",Negative
"I know it's been mentioned before but I do need to add my own experience here. We checked into HK for one night to cut the distance between passikudah and Kandy. I was very unwell due to stomach bug which I caught in Kalkudah and mentioned that during check in because I needed a room that was close to reception area. This hotel stretches over 1 km between the sigirya and the dambulla wings. My plea fell on deaf ears and we were given rooms at the far end of the dambulla wing with Chinese residents occupying all rooms around us. Their kids were left to run around the corridors in wooden clogs , screaming and shouting all day. We had to get out of our room and ask them to lower their voices (screams) several times. I was too tired to leave the room and too weak to make it to the dining area. Next morning I woke up at 6am to the loud voices of more of my Chinese neighbors ... adults this time apparently watching sunrise or just having their early morning caffeine on the bench right outside our room and overlooking the pool area at the far right of the hotel. It was a nightmare. I was told all rooms overlook the lake so I didn't bother to upgrade to a deluxe room and thought superior is alright if it sees the lake. Well it hardly did. Our view was obstructed by huge trees as our rooms were on the 4 th floor. Turned out only the higher rooms had the view. So I spent my one night in a room without a view and for some reason it was extremely dark too. Add to that the constant sound effects of the Chinese folks .... obviously it wasn't a great experience. My husband and my daughter tried the 6th sense world renowned kandalama spa and said that it wasn't worth the money and that all massages they had in our previous hotels were much better. On the brighter side: breakfast buffet was great. Staff was friendly and polite. Monkeys all over the premises added a cute touch. Would I stay there again? Hmmmm .... no",Negative
"Heritance Kandalama is one of the most unique hotels I have ever been to - the architecture is incredible and the views are incredible, to a point where it is hard to describe. Many others here have described the beautiful facilities, so I won’t duplicate their comments. Unfortunately, one of the most significant things we will take away is how overwhelming Chinese tourists were. I do not mean to disparage anyone based on nationality (I have actually lived in China and enjoy Chinese people/culture), but it was often difficult to enjoy the hotel or surroundings because there were so many Chinese tourists who were very loud, rude, and disruptive. The hotel can fit large volumes of people, so the enormous Chinese bus tours stay there, and the common spaces/restaurants become packed with people who are elbowing and shoving their way in line, yelling to each other during meals, and taking selfies in every possible spot. We are big fans of photography, and it was hard to take pictures that did not have a Chinese tourist somewhere in the field of view. If I return to the area, I would not stay at the same place unless management is no longer booking with the large Chinese tours. Instead we would go to a smaller hotel which had equal access to the beautiful surroundings, even if it did not have the same views or architecture.",Negative
"The great positive about this hotel is its stunning views across the lake. There were a few pools, but the curved infinity pool overlooking the lake was stunning and the snack bar overlooking this, a lovely place to sit and enjoy the view during the day.The rooms are good, with a glass shower cubicle looking out to the view. However, the hotel was huge and lacked ambience. The vast corridors opened up to huge spaces with incredible views, but they were just useless ‘spaces’. A better use would have been to allocate more space to the balconies, which were small, concrete shells with a tatty table and plastic chairs. This was a real shame, as there were not really any areas with atmosphere to sit and enjoy a drink in the evening. The spa was extremely disappointing. The brochure advised using the steam room before a massage. However when we arrived, the steam room was not on and would take half an hour to warm up. We waited, but it was still not warm and a very small, plain room and not at all like other Six Sense spas we have experienced The restaurants also lacked any atmosphere whatsoever, indoor and very ‘large hotel bog standard’. Having selected a wine, the waiter bought out a completely different bottle! And the food was average. Breakfast was fairly good - fresh fruit juices, lots of fruit and good egg station. No bircher museli! We were glad we were only here 2 nights.",Negative
"Large hotel built into rocks, on the edge of a huge lake and surrounded by jungle, this should have everything going for it. Yet it seemed cold and lacking in any atmosphere. The rooms were huge - but with not so much as a picture, let alone a mirror, on any of the walls. And the balconies, whilst spacious, appeared to have been made largely from steel girders. Hardly conducive to having a romantic sundowner whilst watching the wildlife on the lake. The buffet restaurant appeared to be just like any other (although it wasn't until we'd experienced similar eateries in subsequent hotels that we realised that the Heritance's was, in fact, one of the better ones) but because so many of the guests - mainly coach parties - had dinner in the buffet included in the price, the a la carte restaurant - which was very good - was usually almost empty, and therefore, once again devoid of any atmosphere",Negative
"Laid back stylish atmosphere, water in the pool clean without chlorine, excellent gym. I chose to have the expensive dinner buffet and the breakfast because I did not want to run the gauntlet of hiring a tuktuk all the way downtown again. The buffets were reasonable but did leave me hungry and had me eat hotel made croissants. First room no view urine smell, front door didn't close properly. got a slightly bigger room with a view, nice until the guests woke up at 5:00 and noise was heard through the connecting door.",Negative
"Perhaps it's just I enjoyed being closer to the real Sri Lanka, but I just couldn't quite fall in love with Kandalama. It has great facilities, the rooms are nice (if a little on the small size for the price) and the buffet is superb. But it just seemed to be missing something for me. Would probably suit someone who just wants to get away from everything and just wants to sit around the pool and doesn't mind paying a bit extra for their drinks.",Negative
"This hotel is spectacularly built into the surrounding hills and greenery, but it could really do with some TLC. The approach is most impressive, and as one reviewer has already noted, looks more like a Bond baddies hideout! Then you start to go into the public areas which are so devoid of life and atmosphere its a bit depressing. Rooms are OK, but again, need some care. We thought we were being inundated with mosquitoes but were reassured that they are just lake insects, which was a relief. Went in for the Gala Dinner on Christmas Eve, which was a truly amazing array of international food, sushi, mexican, french, bbq, japanese and so on. The bbq was outside on the verandah, so every time the doors opened to let people in and out, in came a cloud of smoke, which was not so wonderful. Then the big let down, as it was a holiday, no alcohol served at all! Same applied on Christmas Day as well. However, you could order it from room service and have it delivered to the room. We had the same 4 or 5 Christmas songs on a loop for 3 days which drove us nuts, some change in that would have been good. Having three pools is a bonus as well. Service was very pleasant but very slow. Otherwise all food is a buffet which we did not like, some a la carte to have something small would have made a nice change.",Negative
"The only good thing with this hotel is the view of the lake. The rest is 2 star hotel-, very tired, old, dirty rooms, very poor service. Food very basic. At the end of each meal the staff started helping them self for the food and eating while the guests finishing their meal!!! Had to wait 2 hours to be checked in after 2 o’clock checking time and even then the room was not ready. Poor hygiene at the pool. Big mistake to chose this hotel for my holiday.",Negative
"I don't like to write bad reviews but our stay was so terrible I hope that others know what they are getting for their money. Our arrival was the typical warm and friendly one that we have experienced all over sri lanka. Warm smiles and a nice welcome drink. The views are really stunning, over the lake you can see sigirya. The area is full of kites, mokeys and bats, very special. Buses full of tourists filled up the cafe area so it was a little loud. Upon arriving in our room it was very dirty. Bathrooms are extremely tired looking with scratches all over the insides of the windows, mould and peeling sealant on the windows. Mildew in a lot of places which makes using the bath a gross experience. There was rubbish under the bed, dirty curtains and dead flies all over the balcony. I understand that this is a nature resort (actually why we chose to stay here) but it was clear that the dead flies had been there quite some time. We went for lunch in the cafe as the only vegetarian things on the restaurant menu were a soup and an eggless cake? The menu in the cafe was all western food that you would get in a school or hospital canteen. I ordered the vegetable panini sandwich. What arrived was a burger bun with vegetables and a bit of cheese, cold soggy french fries and a salad. The food was bad but was accompanied by a man sat on a rock playing flute. The flute was nice for about half an hour but soon got very annoying. We went back to our room where we could hear the sound of the flute echoing down the hallway into our room (Jennifer Lopez cover songs). Our room was near the bar and cafe, all night we could hear squeaking of everyone's shoes, loid coughing, screaming children, chairs being moved outside and upstairs and what can only be described as someone bashing pots and pans around at 10pm. No soundproofing at all, and the halls are stone and very open so everything echoes. We had to be up at 4am for a safari so you can imagine we weren't to happy. The next day we decided to give the place another try. We went to the restaurant in the hopes that they could make me something vegetarian. Upon arrival the restaurant was closed for a wedding, something that we were not informed about. We went back to the cafe again, ready for another disappointing meal. We sat for almost 20 minutes waiting for a menu, no staff around at all. Then we waited another 20 minutes after getting a menu, one person working who was rushing around helping wedding guests. The flute man came out again, we got fed up waiting and decided to order room service instead. My husband asked what we could have that was vegetarian, nothing was marked on the room service menu but cheese toast seemed a safe option. He was told that the cheese toast was vegetarian and we could order a basket of sandwiches with egg and vegetable. The food arrived, cheese toast was covered in bacon and the sandwiches contained bacon and tuna. I had cold soggy french fries again. We wanted a drink at the bar, no-one was working there the entirety of our stay so we went back the room instead. I took a shower and had the delight of the wedding photographers drone fly up past my window whilst i was naked. Had the buffet breakfast in the morning, loads of variety and plenty of veggie options. We were sat on a dirty table, went to get food and the table had been cleaned. Why sit us on a dirty table to begin with? Buffet food was all stone cold despite being kept in hot holding cloches and the Scrambled eggs were very undercooked. As a chef this is just dangerous and a great way to give your guests food poisoning. We ate some fruit and left as soon as we could. I am shocked that this place can call itself luxury. We paid over £400 for 2 nights to stay in a dirty hotel with no staff and bad food. The whole place needs updating, the menu needs changing and the prices need to be considerably reduced for Western customers. You could take some lessons from all the other resorts in Sri Lanka that are truly wonderful. This place is cashing in on its views.",Negative
"It was nothing but a nightmare at Heritance Kandalama for me right from the check-in to check-out. This hotel used to be one of the go-to places back in the day, but sadly has lost its glory overtime. The service, room ambience, basic amneties did outweigh the pluses such as the stunning architecture and the splendid surrounding.",Negative
"NO SOUND PROTECTION AT ALL. You will hear every person and noise echoing through your door into your room. And the people banging above and below you. Demand and prearrange that you stay at the very very very end of the hotel away from the elevators, or it's gonna be a supper annoying stay for sound sensitive people.",Negative
"Nothing went well in this hotel. The experience was horrible, and I consider it the worst hotel I stayed at on my journey to Sri Lanka. Moreover, the room was not clean  and there was a spider nest in one of the t+B16ables. Disliked · 1- You have to take off-road for about ten minutes to reach the hotel. 2- The internet is super slow where you can barely use WhatsApp or any other instant messages apps. It is super slow to the limit you can not use google sometimes. 3-The insects and bats are everywhere. To go to the restaurant you have to pass by three bats flying at the entrance of the restaurant. In addition, there was a lizard inside the restaurant next to our table. It was an unpleasant experience at all having dinner at the restaurant. 4- The staff of the restaurant was unprofessional and unfriendly at all. One of them gave us the bill to pay for it and once I told him my booking was half-board he replies rudely you have to pay for the drinks. He could simply be polite and reply "" sorry sir, but half-board booking does not include beverages"". In addition, I asked him for napkins and he gave them to me as like he wants to hit me. 5-The next day, I ordered breakfast to have in my room. I had to wait 45 minutes for the room services to bring it. Unfortunately, when I told the guy I waited for you for 45 minutes he replied "" 45 minutes!!!"" and then looked at his phone as he didn't believe me and then replied impolitely "" oh yes 45 minutes sorry"". Is this an appropriate method to treat the residents? 5-Due to the bad experience at the restaurant, the next day I wanted to have dinner in my room. However, this was an unpleasant experience again. After waiting so long for the dinner, the guy came and to be honest he was polite, but he brought a bill with him and I told him my booking is half-board so the dinner should be included. I called the room services and they told me rudely that half-board booking is only at the restaurant so if you want to have your dinner in the room you have to pay for it! so I asked them to call the manager and he replied I will call him and back to you.",Negative
"We were really excited to stay at this hotel, however our experience was ruined as soon as we arrived. Upon arrival, we were told that the room was only for one person and it would cost an additional $118 US dollars for two people to stay!! We showed the hotel our booking, which was a room clearly advertised for TWO people, but they would not listen and said if we wanted to stay we had to pay the extra. We then asked them to justify how the additional cost had been calculated, which they were unable to do and just said it was a “special price”. We were very shocked at how rude and dismissive the staff were when we were trying to discuss this (smirking and repeatedly pressuring us for our card details).  We ended up paying the amount as we had little choice and it was an embarrassing situation in front of other guests. After we checked in, we then emailed the front of house manager again querying the extra costs. No reply after 2 days, so we chased again. We then finally got a blunt reply, simply stating the price was what it was. We again tried to raise it at checkout, but the staff weren’t willing to engage with us. I note that other reviews describe similar issues with additional costs and a lack of transparency, which is concerning. We will be raising a formal complaint about this with the hotel and requesting a refund, but we want other potential customers to be aware. Please also be aware that taxis organised through the hotel are extortionate compared to local rates. We would always expect hotel taxis to cost a little more, however the difference was laughable. The setting of the hotel is lovely, however it is clear that the management company take this for granted and do not offer a comparable level of customer service. The hotel certainly does not offer an overall 5 star experience in our opinion - the focus seems to be on making extra money at every opportunity rather than any customer satisfaction!",Negative
"This is my fourth time visiting this hotel, its very unfortunate to see how the standard has gone down to zero. When I came to the hotel I requested the lobby to provide me with a trolly to take my bags to the room. Eventhough they had a trolly, the person who was in charge told me to carry my own bags while he was carrying the other bag of mine. So the room service was terrible. Also, the hotel team was continously telling my family that we must check out by 12.00 pm which is fine, but the problem was they were continously nagging us thinking that we won't adhere. Most probably this will be my last time coming to the hotel, very sad to see this glorious hotel going down hill. Appreciate if the management take necessary actions to get the basics right.",Negative
"The hotel is beautiful but our stay was ruined by all the lizards, wasps and insects inside our room! We even changed the room after the first night just for the staff to inform us that all rooms have lizards in them. Will definitely never go back again.",Negative
Had one the worst front office experience I have ever experienced at Kandalama. Reception staff was very non welcoming... and I was honestly shocked to see such behaviour from a reputed chain as aitken spense. Completely abandoned my enthusiasm to book the place in few minutes. Im glad most of the guys dont do bookings in person. Im pretty sure it wont cross zero. Also hotel is poorly maintained might not worth ur extra buck. High time management fix those.,Negative
"I never had the opportunity to visit so call Kandalama since I don't live in Sri Lanka and guess what, I finally had the opportunity and this hotel is crap. For the amount of money that you spend for this place is utter waste. And please, your hotel doesn't deserve a 5 star rating at all. The staff was lazy or frustrated. And what's going on with stewards in the dining hall ? Overall I didn't feel that I was welcomed at all. They were just careless, there is no hospitality. And btw, your bathrooms are terrible. I do understand with this Covid situation it's bit hard to maintain, but if you are open to locals you better treat them right. And please get somebody to watch out those who go to the pool with casual wears. I felt like I am in a lake for a swim with 18th century people. I do not recommend this hotel just like I don't recommend 98 Acres. If anyone here looking for proper Eco friendly hotels, there are plenty and they are much cheaper than this place. I will never ever go to this place and that for sure. And I do not recommend to any. It's the fall of Sri Lankan tourism and you people contribute very well. Good Job.",Negative
Regret to keep a note like this on Kandalama.worst experience on a buffet I ever had.was searching for things to eat which will have bit of a taste to continue. Take your  Thanks Kandalama Heritance for the cake which sent to room for our anniversary which was the only thing eatable during our stay.I believe management will take this positive and make corrective measures.own salt bottle since they never add salt to anything.something really messed up with the chefs or the food tasters of the hotel staff.,Negative
"I and my wife visited the hotel with high expectations for our anniversary. The moment I stepped into the room I was confused and upset to see that it was not the room that we booked. We selected the deluxe king room because it looked cozy for us and it had a jacuzzi and a balcony. But the management had upgraded us to a suite with a separate huge living room I mean I'm happy for the upgrade but use your brain why would two couples on their anniversary require a huge living room which is ok for 2 families. We wanted the original room we booked as we wanted a cozy room and not a huge room and also I wanted the balcony area to be there. After we requested we had to wait for almost 1 1/2 hrs in the room without moving around because of the covid-19. That part we understand but the butler who came to pick up our luggage didn't even inform us that we had to go to the reception to find our new room. I had to use my own phone and call the reception to see what we needed to do. In the new room that we got, the jacuzzi was not working properly and the remote was also not working. Plus the trip switch went off once. I had requested the complimentary anniversary cake to be delivered during the dinner which we didn't receive. Although a couple next to us received a cake. So when I talked to the management we found out that the cake was mistakenly given to the wrong couple!!! and they will send another cake to our room if we wanted one at least use your brain why don't you keep it and give it as a surprise for the breakfast. After being upset about this we came back to our room around 9 pm. At about 10.30 pm we received the cake to our room without even a candle. The dinner was not that great. The meat items had no salt or properly seasoned. The breakfast and lunch were average. The whole area there so much animal poop and not even cleaned. Only thing is that the precautions for the covid-19 were properly followed. Totally disappointed and the worst place on earth.",Negative
"My husband and I along with two guests are currently staying at the Amaya Signature. Wanted to show our guests Heritance Kandalama as a future option to stay in Dambulla. We went up to the security gate and called the reservations department. The hotel reservations department turned down our request to see the hotel but we were told that we were welcome to come in if we bought any food and beverages. Since we are at Full board basis at Amaya Signature, there was no need to purchase food/ drinks. We turned back and came. Don’t think that we or our guests will want to return in the near future. Then we visited Jetwing Lake. What a difference. The staff not only were welcoming but showed the rooms and even offered a welcome drink. We will definitely stay at Jetwing Lake in the future.",Negative
"Had a bit of a worrying incident here today. Not saying anything happened but this is a general warning to travellers. There are currently reports of people’s credit cards being taken away out of sight in hotels and bars and brought back with the mobile machine a few minutes later. In one hotel we stayed in ( not this) a worried client followed the staff member and found him and three other members were taking photos of the card to clone. I am not saying this happened here at all, but we paid for a lovely lunch and instead of bringing us the machine the card was taken away. My husband followed but the server disappeared into the bowels of the hotel past the bar into a staff door and he couldn’t follow. It was some minutes before the card came back, already pushed into the machine by a different server. He paid but then was very concerned as this is exactly what happened to others elsewhere recently . So we have cancelled the card and nothing has gone out. Now I am not saying this happened here but the suspicious nature of removing the card into a back room when there was a card machine on the bar was enough to concern us. So could management please make sure this doesn’t happen in future so everyone can be reassured . And, as we are constantly being advised by our banks about these scams, dear people never let your card out of your sight",Negative
These guys seems expecting white guys only and not appreciating local customers much. Specially their staff members who answer the phone calls get anger tone when asked a question. They seems totally ignoring local bookings.,Negative

"I went to Heritance Kandalama in September with my family. I spent one night at Amaya Lake hotel and one night at Heritance Kandalama which is about 10 mins away. Heritance Kandalama is absolute GARBAGE compared to Amaya Lake hotel. The front desk asked us to go sit in the lobby and forgot to check us in. After 30 mins when I went and asked them they didn't event bothered to say a simple sorry. The staff act as if they own the hotel. The rooms were absolutely horrible too compared to Amaya Lake hotel. Heritance Kandalma feels like a city hotel not a resort by the lake. It feels congested. Please go to Amaya Lake hotel instead. The rooms are much better, the pool is amazing, its actually on the lake.You can get a luxury category room for the same price you pay for a standard room you pay at Heritance Kandalama. The food which Heritance Kandalama is apparently famous for is not that special either. The only action station they had on a friday night was Mongolian fried rice and noodles. Go to AMAYA LAKE hotel Dambulla.",Negative
"Sad to say being a member of a reputed hotel chain in Sri Lanka the customer service was at a very poor level from the entrance itself. One lady who’s working at the reception (can’t remember the name) was extremely rude to us. There’s no cooperation received from them at all. We didn’t feel happy to stay in the hotel. Also, Your quality of food needs to improved in terms of taste. The toilet cleanliness in the suit we stayed was very sad as well. Due to this we actually moved to a hotel few kilometers away from here where we experienced a warm welcome from the entrance till our time of departure. I wouldn’t recommend this place for anyone to visit because the staff members are like this. Their hospitality (at Heritance Kandalama) is very very poor.",Negative
"An absolute disappointment for a ""5 star"" hotel. It's clear staff and management only care about money. From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with one small glass of juice and that's all, despite staying in that scorched lobby for an hour till they prepared our rooms (got one of the rooms almost two hours after check-in time). Also we weren't even notified by staff our rooms were still being cleaned until we asked after waiting to be attended by staff at the lobby for so long... We had four rooms and all were seperated by a quite a bit of distance (if we wanted that we would have booked each room separately). They didn't even provide toothbrushes and according to house keeping ""must request for toothbrushes, if you want it"". They literally charge you for everything despite being on full-board (soft drinks at meal time and for additional water bottles if we were to request for more came with additional charges, just to name a few). Some of the rooms didn't have multi plugs. When we asked the reception about what was included and what wasn't, they provided misleading information. Some of the staff failed to even look and smile or even greet you. Flexibility with this hotel is a no go, they are beyond strict. Utterly disappointed with my experience, not what I expected from a renowned hotel. I hope if one day I am to ever visit again, I hope you guys live up to your name.",Negative
Kandalama hospitality is horrible. I have stayed 2 nights at the hotel. This is the baddest hotel I have ever stayed. First day I went to the dining hall with my husband. He was wearing a casual short. At the door a staff lady told we cant go in coz we have to wear a long trousers. We felt really uncomfortable. We don't know that there is a DRESS CODE to dine in kandalama hotel. We went to relax. Not to follow a dress code. The most unfair thing is they didn't allow us to dine in. Instead of that they said put the plates with food and they will serve to the room. And the best thing is the staff were looking at us like we came from another world. We felt really uncomfortable but we take the plates with food and kept the place to serve to the room. When they serving to the room the food was cold. And we couldn't ask anymore coz we have to go there again and wait until they serve. If they have a rule that for dinner everybody should wear smart casual they should have inform us earlier. Coz we went a trip. Not a office meeting or something like that. If there is such a rule they can talk nicely to the customer and arrange a table some where they can enjoy the dinner. there were many tables in the garden. They could arrange it. Coz of that reason we didn't enjoy the dinner. We were eating cold food. The staff didn't even bother to give us the dinner. They said you cant go in this dress code. No any other option. It was like no food for you. We were the one who asked at least can you serve to the room. They only they said ok. Otherwise no dinner at all. If the hotel has such a rule that's ok. But they should have arrangements to the clients who are not comfortable with that. Coz we pay for the hotel. This is not a free stay. Their hospitality is extremely disappointing. I have been many hotels in the country. None were like kandalama. THE WOREST HOTEL,Negative
This hotel is more like a large Motel. This hotel is highly overrated. No character or history. You are better of staying near Sigiriya mountain. Breakfast was good but it feels like you are on a cruise ship.,Negative
"Hotel would be rated higher given architecture as shown in photos, however some major issues during our stay were unacceptable and downright fraudulent business practices. 1. Reserved at 481.22 for 2 nights room and breakfast. Upon arrival they charged us more than $100 USD above that and would not change the rate despite us showing evidence of the original rate. 2. Ordered a duck confit dish in the restaurant and were served beef dumplings in a cream sauce. Chef argued that it was a confit as if he could slip it past us. I cook duck confit about once a week and am quite familiar with the texture and flavor of duck. I think he realized we were not going to fall for it and then stalked us as we sought other dining options, apparently quite concerned we had seen through the bait and switch. Nothing close to the hotel so limited to on property options. I also ordered a martini with dinner. It had huge full size ice chunks and hadn’t been strained which was not what I would expect at a higher end place. 3. Hotel did not respond to inquiries and requests via email for assistance organizing drivers, and answering questions. Separately, spa on site is actually not attached and requires additional payment to use any facilities which is odd given at checkin I was told there is a steam room and sauna I could use. We will be disputing the difference and sharing this review with everyone we talk to Encouraging them to avoid this hotel at all costs. Very disappointed as apparently they have a reputation for being one of the better options. If you do go, don’t trust them at all and bring paper copies of everything. ",Negative
"First impression bad. By there reception, We felt we were unwelcome guest. Receptionists seemed they choose a guest by looks haha. And view and pools are good. Just... that’s all if you want to go to this hotel don’t expect other than that. 1. Staffs here are not friendly.. some are good. But most of them.. looked like they are tired of guests 2. We had some service assistants came .. and they came in first before asking to come in. Some times they were asking while coming inside. 3. The building is week of noise. You would know what the upstairs do.. we liked jacuzzi(old though) but later we noticed that’s problem cuz when other rooms use the jacuzzi you will know by the noise.. and It bothered us late night. And also some moves upstairs as well. 4. In a room, everything smells so old.. and bad... mold smell. THEY NEED TO CHECK THE THINGS IN ROOMS. Why!!! It looks like abandoned room... spider webs and rusted pot... mold smell. Over all... I don’t get the price of this hotel. The view is great.. pools are good..that’s all I want to remember..Of course some staffs here are good.. but very little number of them. Too expensive comparing everything. Maybe maybe one day is enough here. So.. so far The hotels I experienced in Sri lanka .. this hotel... not good..😧😧😧😧😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦🤮😦😦😦😦😦😵😵😵😵😵",Negative
"No doubt it is a architectural masterpiece built into the natural surroundings but renovations are long overdue.This is marketed as a 5 star hotel, but I’m afraid it is definitely not. Rooms are dark and fittings very tired , and missing items in the rooms that normally come in a 5 star. I.e robes, slippers, fruit, chocolate etc. It’s a huge place and caters for very large groups of tourists. The public areas are large and impersonal , without anywhere comfortable to sit, not a inviting seat anywhere,only metal chairs and strangely upright tables and chairs. The buffets were good, but spoiled by the large restaurant with a school canteen atmosphere. Once renovated it could aspire to its 5 star rating.",Negative
"We were recommended to stay at HK as it is supposed to be the best hotel in the region. However, the disappointment is complete after having stayed at the dream-like Ceylon Tea Trails and the old time charm AmanGalla. 1. the hotel is outdated and lacks of maintenance, 2. We requested to change the room because of extremely noisy neighbours, 3. F&B at à la carte restaurant is simply not at the level of a so-called 5-star hotel. I returned the appetiser as it was barely eatable. This hotel is not part of Ceylon of my dreams.",Negative
"Of all the 5 star hotels that I have stayed in this one struggles at every juncture. The staff is poorly trained and the rooms are just adequate. At check in we ask what the price to add breakfast to our room rate would cost. No one could answer. They barely spoke any English... Once in our room we called for the manager. He could not provide an immediate answer and never followed up. His solution was to have a chef call us to ask what we wanted for breakfast delivered via room service. We skipped breakfast because of the incompetence. We did eat dinner in one of the restaurants (a la carte). The food was just OK and the service was terrible. In Sri Lanka my wife and I stayed at Jetwing, UGA, Cinnamon Lodge, Marriot, The Grand, and again at Heritance Negombo. All of these properties were far better than Heratance Kandalama for a lot less money. Save yourself a headache and money by not staying here! The location is very remote and you are pretty much a prisoner to the bad service and incompetent staff.",Negative
"Overpriced hotel with lots of room for improvement. The hotel has a good lake view. [Room] Rooms are a little cramp. There are also limited power outlets to plug in your laptops or charge your phone. In fact there is only one for guest use. Increasing the number of power socket for Guest use would be useful. The lights are dim. There are limited TV channels. Some tamil channels such as Vijay TV and Sun TV would add to guest's entertainment. There are no slippers provided to wear in the room. As the flooring can be cold, making such footwears available would enhance Guest comfort. Aircon control is not digital. There is a good sea view from the room, but the hotel advised not to open the balcony door as there are monkeys in the vicinity. [Toilet] The toilet WC looks old, it may be timely to replace them. The room comes with bath tub and no ceiling shower head, only a hand held shower unit. This makes it a little unpleasant. Including a ceiling shower head would make showering with sea view a pleasant experience. The shampoo does not come in disposable packaging. Thus, it appears that the same container could be shared by different Guest. This makes hygiene questionable. The Hotel did not replace the toiletries when they make the room. Hotel did not provide toothbrush and shaver. [Restaurant] You have to go to another area to have your coffee after dinner. Coffee is not served to your table. This makes it a little inconvenient. The breakfast spread had beef sausage wrongly labelled as chicken sausage. Upon highlighting, the hotel corrected the label. I hope those who do not consume beef, were not affected by the wrong labelling. [Service] Staff did not readily greet the Guest along the corridors. [Conclusion] If not for the good lake view, the hotel is worth giving it a miss. ",Negative
"For a five star hotel charging £300 a night in Sri Lanka this hotel is awful. It is run down and dated and everything is very basic and uncomfortable. It was a terrible start to our honeymoon and we left feeling pretty stressed after sleeping very poorly for a few nights on an old bed, with lumpy pillows, and very loud old AC. There was no working WiFi, and the whole place felt unclean, cupboard broken, tiny old tv, food not terrible just exactly the same every day at lunch/ dinner. Worst thing however is the staff, they aren’t rude it’s just they are entirely incompetent and useless, and have no understanding of going out of their way for guests - something one would expect at a minimum in a good hotel. This might sound unfair but it was so frustrating and detrimental to our stay having to ask on occasions three or four times over many hours/ days for very basic things that had been forgotten (such as mosquito plug refills or scissors we needed for bandages or for our turn down down to be done later) and actually having to show we were getting angry with the staff and demand they do it before actually doing it. The male staff all just greeted me and not my wife too which made her feel uncomfortable. Sure this is Sri Lanka and one might expect all of this at a local hotel but when charging so much more than other hotels and obviously positioning themselves /charging rates for ‘wealthier’ guests from developed countries they should hire better staff or provide better training to provide the standard of service these guests expect",Negative
"I booked a room in early May on booking.com for an August vacation. I cancelled the room on May 20th, almost 3 months before the free cancellation date. The hotel charged the full amount ($800) and refused to refund my money. They stole my money plain & simple!!!!",Negative
"My first visit to Kandalama was 5 years back (as a honeymoon couple) and then on and off few times. This time we visited as a group, with my friend’s family. Colombo staff told that they will arrange us super panorama view rooms (we paid additional amount) and when we went to hotel we were reserved room 531. There is no panorama view nor even a clear view. I have uploaded 531 room view photo here with. When I asked from staff, their aggressive response was ""yes this is a panorama view room"". Maybe I misunderstood the word panorama or hotel staff has changed the meaning of it. Both mine and friend's rooms were missing tooth hygene sets. We went to the Rashmi Pool around 7.45 and got an aggressive mode response from the pool keeper ""we will close at 8pm "". Yes, we agreed but did not even get a flexibility of 5min. At sharp 8PM, the guy spilt a bucket of chlorine to the pool and I could guarantee that he had not measured the amount of chlorine in it. Dinner and lunch was good but breakfast was not upto standards. I couldn't believe what has happened to the hotel which I visited 5 years back and loved (I have reviewed one time). I could assure if it goes on like this, what will only remain is the great Geoffrey Bawa's design.",Negative
"We called the hotel and reserved lunch buffet for six people. We were told there will be an international buffet. It was quite disappointing to find out buffet is not available when we arrived there. We drove all the way from Colombo for the buffet. They should have told us if the buffet is not available, when we called them. We complained to the front manager (sanjeev) but he took neither responsibility nor any action for the inconvenience they caused us. They just don't care about the customers anymore.

"I have stayed at Heritance Kandalama(fully-paid Deluxe room) in May. According to my 5-level review, the breakfast is nearly 5 star, the architecture and the view is 3-4 star. The room condition and the hotel service is 1 star. I felt very disappointed especially after we compared this stay with our stay at Kalundewa Retreat. We paid the similar price. However the room is much smaller in heritance kandalama. The Jacuzzi didn't work as expected。 What's worse, the drain for handwash is jammed. We spent 20 minutes to open it. In the morning, a monkey opened the door and came in. I called the frontdesk and they promised to send someone to help immediately but never happened.The room is very old and not clean. The supply in the bathroom is very limited. I tried to contact the hotel management to share my feedback. But I have never heard back in the past three weeks.",Negative
"Worst experience in Sri Lanka, I bring my whole family there but it was a mistake... it start by my arrival. We negotiate a taxi from downtown to go there and when we arrive at the hotel, the reception was very rude with my driver because he offered us very low price. The day after I asked the reception to call a taxi, but they offer absurd price which was over the price market. Face to that, we decide to walk and find taxi by ourself but each time the reception team and the security guy make pressure to all drivers to not take us. During all my stay, the atmosphere was tense and horrible with the staff. It’s only during the last day, one of the staff told me: because you come from this country, you have to paid more”. Awful. The management really need to make some training or cleaning in their staff...",Negative
"I stayed in Heritance Kandalama in 2014 and had a great stay. This time, I came back with my family and choose to stay in this hotel again. Initially, I booked two rooms for three of us. Later on, my aunty joined us for the trip, so I emailed the hotel and asked how much is the additional charge for an extra adult without extra bed. I emailed twice through the official website, got no reply. I have the same issue across the board for all 7 nights staying in Sri Lanka, all the other hotels replied except Heritance Kandalama. We arrived at 4pm, a staff named “Nuwan” checked us in. The first thing I told Nuwan is we got one more person, he said he will check. He came back and told me we just need to pay 20USD for the extra adult. I offered to pay now but he asked me to pay at check out. However, problem starts. It’s 10 past 4 and both rooms are not ready although the check in time is 2pm. After waiting for a while at the front desk I said “it’s too slow.” A few minutes later he told us one of the room is ready and start to take us to the room. When we are in front of the room, oh no, it has power problems, it’s not ready. So four of us (three are 70 years old) holding our bags carrying our backpacks standing in front of the room and waiting. Asking him how long it will take, he said 5 mins, and it’s 5mins after 5mins. Then the luggage arrived. The luggage boy just put all of our luggages outside the room and left. At one point, I blow out. I said “ Are you serious? How long are you going to keep us waiting like this?” He said “5mins” and I said “that’s what you said 5mins ago” he then start to apologize and said “we are fully booked today and we have large Indian groups.” “what? !That’s none of my problem!” I asked him how do I make a complain and he told me to ring 0 from room phone. Finally, one room is ready at 4:40 and he just told us the other room will be ready in 10mins and left. We went to the other room a few minutes later and the cleaning guy still inside. We helped him to move the bed. Called 0 but no answer. Fine, I’m already wasted 45mins at check in, I’m not going to waste more time. We went for a swim. When we come back, with wet swimming suit and hoping to take a shower, oh, the shower is not working. Have to call the front desk to send someone to repair the shower. And we were waiting in wet swim wear and cold. I have to say they fixed it pretty quickly, within 10 mins. The story doesn’t end. At check out, I got a bill for an additional person charge of 12000 Rp plus. What a surprise! Nuwan came, I said you told me I need to pay additional 20USD yesterday. He said “Yes, but I checked with the reservation team later, now this is the price you need to pay” ok, so he didn’t check with anyone before he told me I need to pay 20 USD. I said “oh, but you didn’t tell me you were giving me a wrong price” Anyway, I asked to talk to the manager. Reservation manager came and he agreed that as we only have two person staying in each room, I shouldn’t need to pay for an additional person’s room charge. I only need to pay for the additional person’s breakfast and dinner which is 46USD. I asked for a price list and he left for a long time then came back with an excel print out which I can type in any price in excel and print. Anyhow, I’ve already wasted another half an hour at check out, my whole group is waiting for me, I’m just going to pay. To be honest, 46USD is an reasonable price. If I was told this in the email or at check in by Nuwan, I will be more than happy to pay. But that’s not the point. As a hotel, do you know how much you should charge a customer? 20USD initially then 12000rps then 46USD? There is no guide, just do whatever you want. And not reply to guest emails. So much time wasted at check in and check out. I told the management I’m very disappointed with this stay. I was offered some gifts but I didn’t take it. Gifts won’t make up guest’s holiday, good service will. This is a great beautiful hotel but unfortunately with bad management lethargic staff and a cannot careless attitude is my experience.",Negative
"The hotel came with a great recommendation but the reality was very different. Beautiful location but the hotel badly needs refurbishing. The main restaurant feels like a canteen with hardly any outside seating when they have the space and amazing views. Overcharged on our accommodation despite chasing them for two months prior to arrival. Even when we checked in and I raised it again, still no action despite promises....checked out and still outstanding. Will never go back which is a shame as the surrounding area is beautiful, so already found another hotel for our trip in October.",Negative
"I was really looking forward to staying here after seeing all the great reviews here on TripAdvisor...and was greatly annoyed with my stay. I will start with the good bits though- the hotel grounds itself is beautiful and breakfast was good. Staff also nice. The room - horrible. It was tiny with bad lighting, swarming with insects and worst of all, the bathroom was really dirty. I honestly couldn’t tell the cleanliness of the sleeping area because of the bad lighting but bathroom was well lit. The shower blinds were mouldy - how is this okay (for any hotel but ESPECIALLY for a 5 star? Please find attached photos. (I found these problems at another hotel I was staying so keep this front of mind).Wouldn’t stay again based on this - if you are concerned about cleanliness- don’t stay here.",Negative
"I booked one night here and tried to extend it to three nights, trying to take advantage of special rates and stay 3 pay 2 offer. This could not be achieved on the website so I tried to call the hotel. I was passed between two or three people in the hotel, then given another number. After talking with 5 different people and offered a mobile number to call, I was then then cut off. I repeated the attempt twice more with similar results. I sent two emails, then called again twice, same experience. On my fifth attempt I was told that the reservations manager would respond to my email within four hours. He did not. On my sixth international call I gave up. On the following day I finally received a response to my email, saying that I could not change my booking as it was in the busy period. I emailed back again asking what it would cost me for another two nights. The rates had risen significantly since I first attempted contact and the 2 for 3 offer did not seem to apply. I have now conceded defeat bit it really shouldn't be this hard to deal with a 5 star hotel which seems to have plenty of accommodation available.",Negative
"I booked 2 rooms for 2 nights (almost USD1,000) for myself, girlfriend and parents via their official website for a dream holiday in Sri Lanka. Money was charged from my debit card immediately! Unfortunately, immediately after booking I realised that I had made an error in the dates and requested via email cancellation right away. The cancellation was clearly permitted in the contract (cancellation possible 7 day prior to stay without charge). However 4 international phone calls and 3 emails later, after 2 weeks, I have still not received either (1) my refund or even (2) an email acknowledging my multiple requests have been acknowledged or that this being processed. Even when I made the international calls I was passed like a hot potato between receptionist and non-answering phones in the ""reservation department"" each explaining they cannot help. Kadalama - I had high hopes of visiting after rave reviews, but your terrible customer service entirely disappoint me before I even set foot in Sri Lanka. It's not acceptable to scam people of their hard earned money.",Negative
"We are really worried about service of Heritance Kandalam. Our rooms was full with dust. Food ok but the your resturant like normal cafeteria. I m sorry to use that word. Waiters are not enough or they cant concerntrate about guest sometimes no water, no tea at all for breakfast, sometime no cutlaries . . .",Negative
We booked this hotel and compared to other places we stayed it was awfull dull musty rooms very outdated air con inefficient dreadful place very big we booked in and then booked out straight away We were even offered the brides suit as a sweetener even that there best room was oppressive dirty and musty,Negative
"So disappointed with this place, having seen the website and read lots of good things about it. It definitely has a beautiful setting, but that's about all it can claim. The main problem with this place is that it is very much a western style 'big hotel'. As a result it is significantly overpriced, and lacks any attention to detail. We went for a three night stay at the end of a two week holiday, and decided to leave after just one night. The heritance made us pay for the two nights we didn't stay there, but we didn't care - we just wanted to get away. We didn't want to remember what was otherwise a fantastic stay in a great country this way. Unfortunately we found; - dirty bed sheets - old worn bath towels - hotel information docs that were scruffy, tatty and old - the hotel take advantage of the fact you are isolated and that there are no other dining options, so you are stuck with either a cattle style buffet or an a la carte restaurant serving burgers and chips... not really ""Sri Lanka"" - large swams of huge flies creating nests right outside the restaurant door - very little assistance with understanding what activities were available - only a black and white photocopy of a list provided you went and asked for it I wouldn't have been upset if this had been advertised as a 3 star hotel, with costs half what they were. But it was a huge rip off sadly, and not what they advertise. ",Negative
"We stayed in the Heritance for 3 nights, as per the other reviews it is a beautiful hotel in a great location. The biggest disappointment with the hotel was the service, the only thing that was consistent about it was how bad it was, nothing ever came on time, no one would take our order etc. etc. I would really expect more for a hotel of this price in Sri Lanka. A hotel with this level of service in a different location would not survive! Pull up your socks Heritance Management !",Negative
"Well where to start? Let's begin by the pictures which do absolutely not look like the actual hotel: everything is old : elevator, room, lobby..the pictures on booking are purely fake marketing: a shame. The room is not nice, small, no view for our superior room. The bed is uncomfortable and you can hear everybody walking and talking in the corridor leading to it. The A/C works but is noisy. The bathroom is dirty and moldy. The buffet restaurant is just not good and similar from day to day. The price of the drinks are crazy high. Let's talk about the staff : they barely speaks English and the welcome was not what you can expect.. The pools are basic and surrounded by Chinese folks with their kids. We booked two nights trough booking and wanted to cancel the second night considering the previous comments : the management refused despite our blames...really good job guys. 500€ really bad spent...I hope we will be able to laugh about it in some weeks! We hated this place and recommend to anyone to avoid it. Never, ever, ever.",Negative
"The hotel stretches one kilometre from beginning to end, like the wings of large bird, though you would not know, as the hotel blends seamlessly into its jungle and mountainside surrounds. Boulders and rock face are evidence of that integration throughout the hotel. The staff are all very helpful and keen to assist guest in everyway possible to ensure your stay is perfection. Any problems are managed with aplomb and with your interests paramount. Special mention of Vronsky, Sarath & Raksan with great appreciation in that regard. The dining options are many & the food offered is always fresh, pleasing to the eye and the taste buds. The hotel has 3 pools, with an infinity pool into the lake beside which the hotel sits a must to enjoy. The entertainment is traditional music and the jungle monkeys. There are many attractions accessible from the hotel, Sigiriya, Polonnaruwa, Anaradhapura and the local township of Kandalama. The hotel offers hikes and can arrange hot air balloon rides. Heritance Kandalama is extremely aware of its environmental responsibility. It is shown in many ways throughout the hotel, but most especially in its paper recycling plant within the hotel grounds. This plant is well worth a visit and be prepared to be surprised. This was my second visit to this unique and wonderful hotel. I hope my future has a third visit planned.",Negative
"We have just checked in and since checking in we have been suffering from their terrible service. Me and my brother's family is staying here. My brother and his wife are the honeymoon couple. However they provided the honeymoon suite to us, even though we have a child with us (the honeymoon upgrade was meant to be for them). The management said to him that you are the honeymoon couple, so you are getting the upgrade. However when they got in to their room it was half the size of the room we were given. His wife was very disappointed. Although, I asked him to switch the rooms, he was generous enough to let us in the honeymoon suite as we already took our luggage and have settled in the room. But that doesn't make up for the mistakes made by the hotel management. The next thing was more terrible. As we have visited many countries before, we know that their might be a dress code for the swimming pool. So, during checking in my wife specifically asked the staff who was checking us in that if there is any dress code for the swimming pool. She said that there is no dress code. She usually doesn't go to swimming pools where there is dress code as we are Muslim and she likes to cover herself well. But based on this response my wife decided to accompany me and my daughter in the swimming pool. And immediately another staff came in and asked her to leave. We said that we were informed otherwise but he did not listen. My wife moved out politely, however it was embarrassing for her as she had to leave in front of a handful of people. When I complained in the reception all they said was ""sorry"". This is no way a 5 star facility. I will rather say this is a terrible facility with a nice natural view. Unfortunately we have to pass the night with these terrible people. Hope no one else gets the same service.",Negative
"We booked this hotel as a treat to enjoy after climbing Adam's Peak and it couldn't have let us down more. Whilst it is still architecturally lovely and a great setting, they have let their standards fall well below even a 4* hotel. The welcome area felt more like a cheap cruise ship and the room was dirty, dusty and so tired. We booked half board which was for the buffet restaurant which was appalling and worse than a school canteen! I am not a fussy eater, but there was nothing edible that didn't resemble slop. Even the bread was stale. We complained and were offered dinner in the nicer restaurant, but as the air conditioning was broken we had to sit out in the snack area with no ambience. I ordered the lamb which turned up totally raw and inedible. Room service wasn't much better, having to ring several times for laundry to be collected and eventually having to take it to reception and our towels were taken away but not replaced! I could go on but all in all incredibly disappointing and we won't be returning or recommending to anyone. Spend your money elsewhere, perhaps at a Jetwing.",Negative
"Views were breathtaking. However, they DO NOT take food allergies seriously. Even after numerous times of explaining of severe food allergies, food was given, which the chef was not aware of the ingredients. Sustained a life threatening reaction due to non existence knowledge of allergies. No trained staff was available to help. They were too slow to act.",Negative
"A dismal dark hotel , black walls -black floors-black windows . Vegetation overgrowing the exterior making the rooms dark . furniture in rooms broken . service very poor . it took 8 hours for them to supply an extra bed that was pre-arranged .The pools very small and are dirty and surround not paved but are loose dirt/mud. there are only 20 sun beds for the 300 guests !! . the hotel isolated miles away from anything and is at the end of a red dirt track over 2 kilometers . the hotel insists on you using there transport which is 3 x the cost of local suppliers. the hotel food is well presented BUT BEWARE - we both HAD FOOD POISONING from eating the evening buffet and lasted for three days of sickness and worse .",Negative
"This is not a 5 star hotel service people usually expect. I wouldn't recommend it. It is two days before my visit to this 5 star hotel, and I have booked it a week ago. After my booking I have tried to contact the hotel in regards of airport pick up. I emailed many times and called, but unfortunately my english was not good enough to understand the heavy accent. Therefor, less than two days before I travel, I am here frustrating with this hotel. I booked through booking.com, and I have been calling them to get help 5 times today and they couldn't get in touch with anyone in the hotel who can pick up the phone or to decide what to do with my booking…",Negative
My partner and I had arranged to stay for a night at the hotel. We booked for the two of us however the hotel only had one person down to stay in the enormous double room we were given. We went and had a drink and a swim and when we got back to our room a very unhelpful member of staff informed us of the administrative error. She said that since we had only booked for one person (which we hadn't) we couldn't stay in the room and so we had to leave. They refused to refund us for the night we didn't get to spend at the hotel and left us high and dry with nowhere to sleep in the early evening in a very unfamiliar country! This completely ruined our evening and the next day as it took us over two hours to find another hotel that wasn't completely booked up. Appalling service.,Negative
"My girlfriend and I booked this hotel as part of our Sri Lanka tour. Somehow, due to miscommunication, our operator or the hotel booked the room with only one guest. After checking in and relaxing by the pool for a few hours we returned to find the staff questioning our booking. Though we'd been booked into a superior room, which comes with a double bed, the staff weren't happy that two guest were staying rather than one. We were unable to resolve the situation and the hotel had us removed, this at around 8pm now struggling to find accommodation for the night. From what we did see of the hotel it looked very nice, but the staff were extremely rude and unhelpful in a situation we were not at fault for. As I stated before, we'd checked in and been at the hotel for a few hours before they decided we couldn't stay. Very disappointed, this hotel was the only bad experience of an incredible trip to Sri Lanka.",Negative
"Terrible experience and nowhere near 5* status. We are angry that spent a fortune to stay here. Dirty, soulless, awful food, rubbish service. The only good thing was the view. Photos taken from 2nd room after we were 'upgraded' following our complaint! We've stayed in many places all over the world including others in Sri Lanka and can honestly say this is the most disappointing, overpriced and under delivered experience we have ever had. We were so fed up with the hotel we couldn't wait to get out each day and even tried to relocate to another hotel. Awful - would give zero score if I could.",Negative
"Reception unimpressive, hotel very faded and worn, extremely expensive for everything, food priced at 5 star big city eg new york levels especially the snack restaurant. Also you are in the middle or nowhere so you have no options but to eat the lukewarm food at crazy prices. Transportation manager tries to up sell you continuously on a bigger car. V pushy. Obviously on commission, he is more expensive than if you ask at reception when he is not there. We booked the hotel because of its ratings on tripadvisor etc. However the good ratings are very old, newer ratings are v bad but average is still high which is inaccurate. It hasnt been refurbished in over 10 years. We booked for three days and would have left immediately on arrival. However be warned the cancellation policy is to charge you for the full stay, which is not made very clear when you book. It's all very buried in the small print. Be warned. I would avoid this overpriced unwelcoming 3 star at all costs. If you have to see the location, go for lunch or dinner.",Negative
"We expected a 5 star hotel but we were very disappointed! The food is terrible, the waiters don't understand English. The room is not clean, the shower full of ants and the balcony door doesn't close completely so the entire room had insects. We were going to stay two nights but decided instantly to reduce our stay for only one night!",Negative
Having visited many time to this hotel we were expecting the same level of friendly service. Sadly this place has lost its touch. You have to wait outside for meals till a table is free most times. The girls wearing black who manage the tables seems to don't care about customer service. Each time we ask for a table of 3 they scratch their heads as if we ask for something difficult. In the meal area it is organised chaos by the staff. Tea and coffee guy runs around trying to serve tea or coffee without previously keeping cups. Each table asking for tea the guy runs around with the tea tray trying to get a tea cup. Food was quite average and similar food served almost every time. Staff is poorly trained by the management. Hotel room fittings are outdated. The room we stayed had a leaking shower cubicle. Even after they added silicon glue as a temporarily fix didn't work. Sadly this elegant hotel designed by a famous architect has lost its touch due poor management and bad service,Negative
"Just arrived and so let down Dark , and dull and the atmosphere of a 1970s block of flats Never arrived at such a dull reception. Tired and very poor for what paid Wish I had brought my head torch. What a depressing hotel. Great location of course but unless you love drab and grey look elsewhere for better value Food yet to review but hopes not high",Negative
"Hundreds of tourists packed together. Restaurant completely full, plenty of children, noisy, no charm at all. It's like being in a factory. Modern times of Charlie Chaplin? Not my idea of a 5 stars hotel! ",Negative
We had some issues with our travel plans and they gave us not flexibility to find a solution. I don't understand how such a great hotel (with rates that are 10 times the price you often pay in Sri Lanka!) must treat customers so badly.,Negative
"At first, we are so impressed by the environment and modern design of the hotel. We did enjoy a wonderful day in hotel so we decide to extend to stay one more night. However, on the second day, our friends' money were stolen inside the room from they backpack, while they are out of swimming. They bags were being opened and some of the dollar notes were gone. They lost around usd100. The point that most disappointed to us was the attitude of they staffs. The manager named (kachanna) very arrogant that he didn't care about you. Their staffs are irresponsible that they pushes the responsibilities to each other. They even blame us for not putting money in safety box. Not CCTV can be checked back. The door bolt also fragile that easily break down. Light at night suddenly black out for few seconds. The hotel gave us unsafe feeling that we decided to leave on that night. It totally ruin the imagine of Sri Lanka. It is the worst experience of us in Sri Lanka. We don't expect of this kind of treatment in a so called 5 stars hotel. Please improve the security and has better staff management, otherwise, such kind of things will keep happening in this hotel.",Negative
"Sorry to say I'm still at this hotel for another day and night. Heritance Kandalama is the 3rd hotel I have stayed at on my 2 weeks holiday in Sri Lanka. This hotel has put a damper on my holiday. because the other two hotels I stayed at, were great in every way.Rooms, service and food. Heritance Kandalama is completely opposite. To say that they are saying that the hotel is 5 star, I would only give it 31\2 to 4 stars at the most. Rooms are looking very old and tired and not very clean. Not many of the staff smile. As for the food where do I start, Hope you like buffets, because that is all they have. I did try a beef burger at the bar tonight, never had a burger like that before. There was no beef patty, only pieces of meat with sweet chilli sauce and onion. It is a shame, that they let their standards drop, because its it has a great outlook.I advise you not to go",Negative
I've been to so many hotels around the world and I've never been so disappointed as when I arrived at the hotel. The hotel is run down with bugs covering the wall. I spent 4 days there and not once did I see them wipe the marble floors that were covered in dusty footprints. It has no atmosphere whatsoever. I met a couple who asked me if I also felt like it was a let down. The photos give you a completely different idea... Does not have the same polish you see in the photos. We were totally bored there as it's in the middle of nowhere.... 3 hours it took us to get there by car. Spent the whole trip wishing I had gone elsewhere!,Negative
"This is the most disappointing hotel stay we have ever experienced from what is supposed to be a 5* hotel. We were exposed to multiple problems during our 2 night stay. The first problem we encountered was a gap in our bathroom windows. This led to 100s of beetles being able to come through the gap into the bathroom window. This made use of the shower extremely limited and we had to throw certain items of our own away because these beetles had infested them. What is more disappointing is that we informed the staff who assured us that they would deal with the problem whilst we were at dinner by putting sealant in the gap. This did not happen and we were subject to further infestation when we came back from our meal and during that night. Another issue was the food. 5* food should mean a certain standard of preparation. We had the buffet on the first night where I found a cooked CATERPILLAR in my stir fried vegetables. The management of this situation was poor. There should have been immediate removal of the food from the buffet. Sadly the chefs attending the food seemed happy to just give it a stir and leave it. They may have exchanged it later but having watched them, it didn't occur during the time we were dining. A token apology was given by the chefs. Not enough in this standard of hotel.Other problems included leaking ceiling where the luggage in the room was kept. By this stage we were fed up of trying to complain. Another member of our group had a dirty kettle in their room that smelt of rotting cheese. Presumably someone before had boiled milk in the kettle. This is sub-standard room management in checking their equipment. All of our group had rooms with a gap under the door. This allowed insects to come in during the night. We had to roll up towels to block the gap. The first 3 complaints were put in to writing at the end of our stay. This was addressed to the general manager. A verbal apology was given by the presumed duty manager at the time but they seemed lost for what to do or say next. A sign of a poor standard hotel is that the duty manager and general manager are unable to respond to the complaint letter. Given the way this was handled we presume they will continue to manage on a false reputation rather than attempting to maintaining 5* ? standard. Extremely disappointed.",Negative
Only have dettol and pandal for first aid kit. Only a single key for a double/triple room. And for trek they are charging 550 per person which is pure day light robbery. Basically they charge for everything. Not sure how they got so many good reviews. Must be they are posting it by themselves. If there were negative rating then would have given -5 instead of 1.,Negative
"Beautiful setting.... at a price. I write this review from my room. This is not a 5 star hotel and is grossly incongruent to the impression given by trip advisor. I wonder if review ""massaging"" has occurred? One star rating by me is overly harsh, but I feel necessary to try to counterbalance the 4.5 star given. It really deserve a 3/5. Pros: 1. superb setting by the lake and amazing panorama from public terraces. 2. Interesting architecture encorporating natural rocks Cons: 1. Terrible, terrible value for money. The room price and the food. $30 buffet of dubious quality. Service charge added for a self service restaurant - a bizarre and arrogant addition that sets the overall tone. 2. Room is grotty, poorly cleaned with a dusty bathroom and tired furniture. My wife states why pay to stay in a place that is not as clean as home?( 5 star??) 3. Dated building with vacuous open spaces and tired paint work. Plenty of squashed mosquitos in a lift not fit for a 3 star hotel. Looking at alternatives the Thalika (?spelling) rated no3 looks much better. Half the price, clean and more up to date.",Negative
"We booked this hotel to stay for one night. We arrived at 7 pm very tired. Wanted to have our room ASAP but after 1hour approx waiting time we finally got our room at worlds end full of bees. We refused to stay as there wasn't any view. Opening the window for view means inviting bees in rooms. Anyway, he brought us back to reception again to give us room another side. Than said oh, we can give you a room which is very nice and no bees. Again same story, he brought us same floor all the way to give us room on the same floor next to other room we saw. After two hour, we finally decided we are not going to stay in this god forsaken hotel where nobody know what they are doing?",Negative
"Setting is definitely unique and fits the description of a wonderful experience of harmonizing with nature. We loved seeing the monkeys from our shower. Unfortunately, we had difficulty appreciating this due to the clientele who did not respect the staff. They were rude and demanding with no appreciation for the setting they were in. Akilla the pool attendant wanted to do something about it yet we did not want him to do anything for fear of the repercussions. We likely stayed at the wrong time but suggest the hotel scrutinize unruly guests more closely. The worst we have ever seen in our travels and we travel frequently. One example is someone putting their leg on a restaurant table... Enough said!",Negative
"The worst experience in Sri Lanka!! We booked the triple room during xmas this year,the reception guy said we could hv an extra bed but after several hours waiting,there is still no bed! when we asked again,the staff at the reception is really RUDE!! we can not believe this is the best hotel in country!!! for me,this is the worst experience ever!!!!!!! i would highly encourage all the tourists NEVER visit this hotel!!!",Negative
"I can't believe that this hotel is top rated in Dambulla. I suppose there is nothing else. Our stay here was the low point during our trip to Sri Lanka. After staying at the lovely Tintagel in Colombo, we were sorely disappointed to arrive here. We thought about leaving Sri Lanka, really. I'm looking at the photos posted on here by the hotel and marketing agents and they have to really be photo-shopped. Our room was dark and dingy with 20 year old furniture and rotting fruit. I agree with another reviewer that said it was like a cheap motel. The only nice part of the room was the bathroom. You couldn't even see out the windows as they were all fogged up. Also, since the hotel was on the edge of an artificial lake (a ""tank""), there was a SERIOUS bug problem. The hallway walls were white, but actually looked BLACK due to the number of mosquitoes (I was told they were ""tank flies"") on them. I have never seen anything like this. Not good when the hallways are open air - have to run into your room to avoid copious amounts of bugs following you. Also, I was working in the living room late one night on my laptop and a large, one foot long lizard crawled out from behind the VCR. These lizards are not like the small geckos in India! My husband was pretty upset about being woken up at 2am to deal with this problem! Oh and the food! The food was miserable. They had a mandatory buffet for $30/person. It had about 25 dishes and they were all bad. Super fancy and complicated dishes that the chefs were unable to execute at all. They should have stuck with a few simple, well-made dishes. I resorted to eating dinner rolls by the second night. For $30. By the third night we had discovered the bar with lion beer and spicy snack mix. Far superior. There were no other options for eating as we were in the middle of nowhere. Almost every single person here was part of a tour group and I suspect paid much less to stay here than we did. Each night at the buffet there was a different group of people - we were the only constant fixtures for 4 nights. It was like prison. I can't believe we paid over $250 per night PLUS $60 for each dinner to stay in prison. On the plus side, we had a lovely time visiting Sigiriya and especially Polonnaruwa. There must be a better place to stay in this area.",Negative
"Discomfort at a star class price: After writing the below review last week , a manager from Kandalama called me and apologized over the phone and confirmed that he will personally come to talk about the situation which he never did for almost a week. Further he asked if I can remove the review which had been describing all the discomfort we had during the stay and I was kind enough to remove the review, the first place. The bottom line is that you cannot even trust a manager at Kandalama so don't be amazed if the junior staff give you a hard time. They have started spoiling the image of once told to be the wonderful hotel ""Kandalama"" , but not any more. The original review is as below; We selected Kandalama for our annual trip after analyzing all the other options , hoping to get five star service and quality. We had booked 80+ rooms with a huge budget expecting a star class service and food from the hotel . Finally we realized it was just a another big mistake , going there. After arriving at the hotel , we got to know that they do not have the rooms that we had already confirmed and after many unfriendly conversation from the hotel staff for almost an hour we were given a sweet for 4 ppl , where we are supposed to get 2 double rooms to be shared among our office crowd. (Luckily it was the friends from the office , otherwise they be putting two families in a single sweet - an imagine how that will be ) The food was not that we expected , the barbecue was extremely raw , most of the ppl ate from the hotel end up getting stomachaches at the end of the trip. The rooms were not clean and there were signs of wear and tear in some places . There were frequent power failures and once the technicians had to come to our room to fix an issue. Buffet and food: There were too little room in the buffet area for the ppl in the hotel where we were asked to wait outside for 20 , 30 mins till we get a chance . (this is the first time , I have been told like that from a hotel in my life). It was like winning a lottery to get a seat at the dinning area , and even then though you tell the waiters to get the table ready , they did not care even to serve water on the table. I think the management was too busy getting reservations from ppl , they forgot the ppl have to have their meal at the buffet. Most of the time , the food containers were empty where it took a long time for them to refill them. The place is good , since its among the trees heading the lake . But the question is , if the service and food is very bad , if its worth spending five star money for a place like that . The very reason you come for a place like this , is at least to be treated well. I would NOT recommend Kandalama to anyone who has an intention of going there. Try some place else , a bit worth the value one . ",Negative
"Definitely the worst hotel we have stayed in at this price range. Ok i agree that it is well sited and it is eco friendly. It once may had some of some architectural merits but I think it has dated very badly. The interior is very poorly configured, large uninviting open areas serving no purpose. The service standards leaves a lot to be desired and the rooms are worse then a cheap motel. The bathroom was not cleaned properly and the rationed towels were grey with age and countless washing. Hotels are business ventures but this was almost mercenary in its charges. A cold, unfriendly place and poorly managed. Will def not return nor will it be recommended.",Negative
"Please beware that if you want to do anything outside the hotel you will be forced to pay outrageous money. E.g. just to get to the closest town - Dambulla. We were offered SINGLE ride to escape the hotel for more than 3150 Rps which is approximately 60 USD for 12km of ride!!!! We have called the taxi agency in Dambulla we have found on the internet and were offered a guided round trip for the same price, and even 1000Rps less when going by tuk-tuk. In addition if you are targeting for some sleep avoid this hotel. If not you might find yourself taking sleeping pills to override the sound of the electricity generators. Also do not forget to put the silent tab on your knob otherwise the persistent staff will make you get up and come to the door to explain that 9 am is not a good time for housekeeping. Last but not least the internet prices displayed on the web slightly differs from the actual ones, surprisingly the real one are more pricy.",Negative
"We stayed at hotel Heritance Kandalama, the hotel is superb but we were stolen 300€. We did not leave the money at the safety box so its our foult but I think it is easy to forget values at the room mainly when you think nobody will entry. We were having dinner and they did the room agin, when we come back we realized 300E were missed, somebody from the staff should have estolen them. We told the reception desk but answear that they could not be responsible to values not in the safety box. We have been travelling aroun modest hotels and never had this bad experience before eeven if sometimes you forget some values. So TAKE CARE",Negative
"only stayed here 1 night thank goodness, our 'luxury' room with view of sigiria rock was anything but, very disappointed, bathroom covered in soap scum/water stains. could hardly see out from the balcony as was so overgrown with the creeper, with pitiful warped table not even any chairs to sit outside. given other reviews on trip advisor perhaps we just had an older room, however this was certainly not reflected in the price. one plus food was sensational, if you can just go for lunch or dinner would be better",Negative
"Before you select this hotel, please do not make the same mistake we made. Do read the Trip advisor reviews under “Terrible” so that you make an informed decision. We, i.e. I, with my wife and our teenage son, who consider ourselves experienced travellers, did not do so, and we were utterly disappointed. If you read some of the “Terrible Category” reviews, you will read about guests, who had prepaid for multiple nights, and decided to have early checkouts rather than be “imprisoned” in this hotel. Since the hotel is not cheap and fore going prepaid nights hurtful, it goes to show how disappointed one can get. For us arrival at the hotel was a nightmare. A young lad at the entrance asks us to follow him, walk up a ramp to the next floor, taking us to the swimming pool area, asking us to sit down and, then a Trolley lady appeared offering three choices of welcome drinks. (Three of us tried the three drinks and they were awful having been made and kept from ancient times it appeared.) The young lad now tells us we had booked two rooms but Agoda’s reservation showed 2 people only and since we were three, we will be charged USD35 extra for one night for the extra breakfast. Having already pre-paid close to USD400 for 2 rooms for one night, we told the person this we would have no problem with (although we felt the charge was steep) . Delighted at our immediate acceptance, this young lad made my wife and me sign a form, and then told us that our rooms were ready and we could follow him. With the lad in front and the three of us behind him, we were instead taken back to the front of the hotel and then led into a dark and a dingy room which we were then told, was the office of the hotel cashier and we needed to pay the $35. Amazed at this person’s trickery, I protested and wanted to see the Duty Manager, as we could have simply been told this where we had been sitting and we could have given cash or credit card if settlement had to be done upfront, and not led back in to this dingy cashier room in this manner with my wife and son tagging along. To make a long story short, neither the Duty Manager nor the hotel GM had the courtesy to see a complaining guest who had expected a five star reception and here this young Mr. Sly had done what he did. After a 4 hour rickety drive to the hotel, we were tired and exhausted and did not appreciate to be treated in this manner. For complaints, Guests are at the mercy of another young and quite inexperienced Guest Relations Executive, one Miss Nimanthi Bandara who tried to justify the episode blaming it on Agoda “as they always do wrong bookings” and totally ignoring that the issue of $35 breakfast was not even contested by us and we did not have to be lied to bring three of us back from the swimming pool check-in area to this Cashier room for the settlement of $35. She uttered no words when asked for seeing the Duty Manger/GM either being too scared of them, or under orders from them to ignore any such guest requests. I suspect that senior management staff at the hotel are probably related to hotel owners or else they would not hide behind the skirts of guest relations executives when guest issues come up. About the hotel itself, you will understand this hotel if you read the historical story of Slave Island in Colombo where Dutch occupiers are said to have kept their African slaves in a small island in the middle of a lake, and had introduced crocodiles in the lake so the slaves could not run away. This hotel, built nearly a decade ago, has what appears to be a few kilometres of mud path as the only access to the hotel, so forget about finding any shops or restaurants or any type of transport near or around the hotel. Your only link to the world outside is this mud path, infested, as we were told, with wild monkeys, snakes, elephants and large monitor lizards. We saw only one open restaurant in the hotel which is a large hall where breakfast, lunch and dinner are served. Staff here is another story. Usually such restaurants have a pleasant, smiling and a welcoming person to usher the guests in. Not one of these three qualities were in the lady assigned this work here. Barefoot service staff here may “add” to the local touch but it cannot make up for poor service and poor training. Once in the hotel, there is hardly much activity. The swimming pool is small and crowded. The lake can be seen from a distance and far away. And, be ready to pay an arm and a leg for the hotel’s buffet lunch and buffet dinner in the hotel, or for going to nearby city called Dambulla in the hotel’s car ( there are no taxis or any other type of alternate transport). And in fact there is not much in the city of Dambulla either. We will not go this hotel again and do not recommend it to others.",Negative
This hotel is placed in a beautiful location with good view of Kandalama lake. There are two wings one boasting view of Dambulla ancient rock temple other Sigiriya wing where you could see a glimpse of Sigiriya ancient rock frotress. Actually this is not true rooms at lower floors has no view at all only the top floor rooms has so called view. We paid for triple room and additional person to share double bed in reality which was small room with two beds . After we complained they said they can put additional bed but then there is no room to even put a leg on the floor. Room service was poor. When ask for something they pass the bug from one person to another. Quality of food is good.We paid for three days but left after one day stay. If you really want to see the hotel I recommend you go for lunch or tea and return back. Road to the hotel is muddy so you have to clean your vehicle on return. In our stay in Sri Lanka We stayed at Hotel Taj Sumudra in Colombo and Grand Hotel in Nuwara Elliya they were Fantastic,Negative
"This was my 1st visit to this kind of hotel and would be the last. I after 4yrs took family retreat with wife,parents and mom in law for the 1st time. Had heard randomly that property is good and all that required to hear when you plan something for vacation. But the day we landed i.e. 10th Jan 2012 (2200hrs) had to rush as room dining does serve Indian food after 2100hrs as per the order taker, we go in the same shape to Buffet and then by 2330hrs we needed water bottles so I called the Room Service and asked him 10 water bottles, he started in his own way (as if he is the owner of the property or my very good friends- HIGH Handedness) that sir this will be extra charged - I say yes not an issue then he says ok and calls me back in 20mins with the quote of some SriLankan 1390 rupees. I asked him can you please deliver it fast rather counting bucks at this moment? He says its better to let us know or else (giving me 2 examples of guests he had experience) that they had complained saying why extra charges? I get pissed and call the duty manager (imagine for simple room service order I had to call the Duty manager Sanjeeva) and said need the bottles ASAP as we need to sleep and go ahead tomorrow for site visits. I get the bottles after 40 to 45mins. I forget and sleep that night (must be my bad day) second day 2 stories to narrate. We all after the sweating site visits come and want to go for a dip in the pool (which is absurdly built- please be careful in this pool 2mts deep and has a rope making partition where my dad slipped his feet and I could help him out of it) When we arrived at the pool area we were changing our clothes and I see a European or a UK national undressing and directly jumping in the pool without the head shower kept especially for use. But while we change the pool attendant comes and tells us we need to have shower I tell him shall we take the shower straight away in the clothes or after we change- and is this rule only for Indians or even the Europeans as well he has no answer smiles and goes. The height was I order 1 Carpe De Parris and 1 Mojito for our family the bar waiter comes, I and my dad sitting on the pool with our legs in the pool water ask him to serve our drinks - he comes up with Sir you need to come out and drink not in the pool. I request him that we know drinking in the pool is dangerous and we aware of that but he says NO come out and then drink. Again in request him that here is the table you place it we would have our sip keep it on the table and then come down to swim on which he says (Yohan waiter's name) NO I cannot serve you, you better come to bar and then have the drinks) I meantime saw few couples (Europeans or UK) having their Wine tulips hugging each other inside the pool with their glasses? What ridiculous way of treating guests. We have booked 2 Suites in this hotel. No one has our profile idea and we get treated like this? I mean which Management does this hotel has? Then I ask for the GM as needed to report then and there, but there was no GM, no responsible looking person in this Jungle property. Then there suddenly 2 Resident managers to the rescue all of a sudden and asked me so narrated them twice these happenings, they were like Sorry and we will look into this matter and stuff and we would make it complimentary and stuff. But I asked them 1 question that can somebody compensate my family's quality time I wanted to spend and why such Racism all of a sudden? they had no answer to it. I straight away checked out with 60 plus parents and wife 1500hrs without a drop of Water and meal. I made sure i pay them the 10 bottles, and extras we had done of USD 158 or else someone would read this and say we needed compensation. Answer is NO, such a disgrace where Indian market has always been and is the number 1 to Srilanka (when the war was on or even after that) and this kind of treatment? We then went to Dear Park and spent there 2nights which were the best days in our lives. All simple but homely, comforting less staff more guests (russian groups, Indians groups etc) but not a single noise or such discrimination. I would never recommend this to anyone who wants to go with his family, high profile guests or whoever to this hotel. DISGRACE, Mismanaged and Racist!!!",Negative
The hotel was built against a cliff and is overgrown with creepers that make the rooms dark. There are monkeys in the creepers so you cannot open the balcony doors and with no fly screens you would not want to! The air conditioning did not work properly and the bedroom smelt 'musty' of stale air.The food was average to poor and cold at times. The staff did not understand the concept of service in the restaurant. The location was very remote and looked across a lake which was nice. There were 3 pools of which one was in use. Facilities were limited and not extensive.,Negative
"I went to Sri Lanka for the first time last Dec 2010. Having just been to Tea Country, it was hard to impress. However, nothing could have prepared me for the other extreme. It was one of the worst hotel experiences I have had. Putting itself out as a 5 star hotel is a joke. The architecture is pretty impressive and the settings and surroundings stunning. However, having built itself practically into a rock face provides guests with the charming smell of bat guano. We arrived late one evening only to find the lobby in complete darkness. Fine - lets save on electricity. We were then taken to the outside lobby - really impressed by the lake - and stood next to a mock giant snake. OK. What next I thought? We were then taken by lift down to our LUXURY room and got out of the lift to be greeted by the smell of bar droppings. The corridors were extremely dark thanks to the proximity to the rock caves. Our LUXURY room was old, dark, the pillows were extremely floppy (those with bad necks beware!!), no proper duvets only sheets (never come across those since university days 15 years ago!!). Right - not quite working out. Next we walk into the bathroom - hey - I thought this decorative concept of having rows of uncovered lightbulbs surrounding the bathroom mirror was very 80s!!! Decide to take a shower only to realise that the designers of the hotel must have realised that guests walking around the estate can see into the bathrooms! The solution - lets stick a plastic rubber sheet on the windows! Our room was so utterly depressing it was honestly really hard to stay there. We then paid for an upgrade to a suite - which was actually much much better as the rooms were newer, you got bathroom slippers (not available in LUXURY rooms), and a lot more spacious. The lightbulbs around the bathroom mirrors were still there - but at least all the lightbulbs worked (unlike the LUXURY room). More importantly, the suites are located on the higher floors so when one is not greeted by the smell of bat droppings and the surroundings feel a lot more airy and brighter. However, being close to nature meant that when we got back to our rooms at night outside the room door must have been hundreds and hundreds of insects zooming around. Luckily these weren't mosquitoes and were all dead on the floor the next morning only to be replaced by another batch of a couple of hundred insects in the evening. Regarding food. Big tour groups I think would be pretty happy here. Dining halls are huge with a lot of variety. For couples looking for a quite evening, there is a fine dining restaurant but with really average food plus a 3 page menu. Seriously - not much variety. Westerners beware - don't bother with the steaks etc. The decorations were quite something in the sense that I have not seen anything this bad for sometime. Perhaps it was the giant hooded snake that I stood next to whilst trying to check in. Or the giant suspended iron owl outside the main restaurants (actually it had 2 heads). Or possibly the mock polar bears in the main dining hall. Seriously speaking - going for an extreme minimalist look by just getting rid of these hideous creations would have given this hotel a much more classy feel. My summary of the trip (1) for couples looking for a quite time together - please please please do not even think about this place (2) for group tours - probably makes sense. Everybody can tuck into the massive buffet spreads in the morning (3) value for money - I felt absolutely ripped off by a hotel claiming to be 5 star charging US$300 per night (4) I was actually looking forward to checking out and leaving this place. To anyone even considering Kandalama, please please do not be swayed by the huge % who have voted for this hotel. Complete and utter joke.",Negative
"We stayred here in February this year. We had booked a Superior Room, be warned that Superior in Sri Lanka means Standard, but we didn't know that until we were given our room and had to make a complaint. The room we were given was very nicely furnished but you couldn;t see out of your window to the lake beyond because of the green creepers cascading down from the balcomy above and so on and so on. When I made the complaint that thwere was a beautiful view I was told that this foliage was the wishes of the now deceased architecht who wanted to build an hotel which totally blended into the countryside!! We were eventually moved to much nicer room where we could see out. However you can not leave your terrace door open as all your stuff would be taken by the unbelievable amount of monkeys around. These aren't ""aren't they gorgeous"" monkeys they are what we in the west would call vermon and they are nasty. The pool is an infinity pool where you can look over the edge and spot more monkeys and the occassional elephant being ridden by a guest of the hotel. The area around the pool is not particularly spacious or nice. Food in the main restaurant is poor and is reminds me of a holiday camp...all self service and as my partner got food poisoning I suspect not properly heated through. This was the same of the ""posh"" restaurant where I attended alone one evening as he was too ill to dine...the food I got was only lukewarm. The staff however were very friendly, apologetic and most helpful and concerned while my partner was ill...which went on till after we had left the hotel. While he had to stay in bed there were no comfortable public areas for me except in on the settee in the bedroom but then I couldn't open the window unless I wanted to entertain monkeys. Also because it is so rural there is nowhere else to walk to safely. This hotel is certainly not up to the standards I know there are in Sri Lanka and I now believe in the Kandalama area too. I would not go back there",Negative
"I decided to choose Heritance Kandalama because of some good opinions Tripadvisor members wrote on it. However my experience could not have been worse. Definitely, this establishment is not a 5 stars hotel. Rooms are tiny, walls are plenty of stains, bedlinen is dirty and never changed unless you specifically so say. I could see the same stains on my sheets every single night (I stayed for 4 nights). They offer no complimentary toothbrush, comb, etc. Just 2 shower caps. Service is awful, staff is unfriendly and inefficient. I had to wait for a coffee for 15 minutes, and when having dinner I had to beg for a bottle of water which they never brought. Too busy?, perhaps. Anyway they seem lazy and without interest in customers´ satisfaction. But the worst was still to come, one afternoon after a whole-day excursion we came back to our room and the door was open, anyone could have entered it just by pushing the door. Of course, the management would not make responsible for any loss whatsoever. Fortunately no personal goods were missing. To sum up, if you want to visit Sri Lanka ancient cities, I would recommend you to stay anywhere else.",Negative
"We travel extensively in Sri Lanka every two years. This is the worst hotel we have stayed. It was a nightmare!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!_ at the entrance they handed out a water lily to my daughter but refused to give one to my son when he asked for one because he was not a ""girl"" which got him all upset.- my kids wanted me to play the piano for them (as I am a piano teacher and since there was no other live entertainment) but could not get a tune going as it was out of tune and most of the keys were not working. I have never seen a piano in such terrible condition in any other hotel in Sri lanka.- When we went to the 7th floor pool we were shocked to see a snake entering the pool and there was no pool attendent.- the balcony on the 7th floor is very dangerous for young kids as they can easily fall.- the kids took a bath in the jacuzzi and it took most of the night for the water to empty and I could not take a shower as the water would have overflowed. If you are a kid or an older person the jacuzzi was quite a challenge to get in and out.- the monkeys had takenover our room balcony and it was not safe for us to sit out as they came to our chairs. There was no sign to warn us or tell us not to leave the balcony door open. When I turned to enter the room the monkey went right past me and took a small package from my handbag which was on the bed and ran to the jungle. Thankfully it was not my wallet or camera but I was more concerned for my children as the monkey could be rabid and what if the kids were bitten or scraped?- The reception at the front desk was not very warm nor welcoming. The manager was horrible when I told him about the discount they were running to celebrate their anniversary he said it finished the day before and could not give me any discount.- for almost $200 a night PLEASE I beg you there are much better, beautiful and welcoming hotels in Sri Lanka for one fifth the price (I would highly recommend Sigiriya village hotel which is not very far from this hotel for warm and friendly staff, excellent food, value for your money at half the price and an overall pleasant experience) It is a big marketing campaign run by Aitken Spence travels to get people to visit their hotel. LET ME TELL YOU IT IS LOUSY!!!!!!!!!! If you enjoy throwing your hard earned cash go ahead. Most of the visitors were people who had booked their vacation through travel agents who put them only in Aitken Spence hotels in Maldives and Sri Lanka. Most said they would never visit this hotel again and you can count me and anybody who will visit Sri Lanka that I come into contact with and all my relations and friends in Sri Lanka.",Negative
"My second visit to 'Ka' purely driven by my first experience was a mistake. It's pretty much homely, eco friendly retreat but I guess we should have been more careful of our personal belongings. The way they managed the complaint was simply unacceptable when they said that the item was taken by a monkey on the terrace during dinner!!!! We all know that monkeys do not go scampering around dinner tables in the night. Anyways we learnt to be more careful and trust less of the service delivery staff.",Negative
"What a disappointment! We had heard great things about this hotel, and were excited to visit…. Unfortunately it does not live up to expectations. The building is beautiful and the lake view - incredible. BUT, the hotel is old, the food is average and the decor non-existent. You walk around a building with blank walls, and echoing corridors, to a restaurant with cold, boring, very average food. For the price they charge, this is not worth it. There are plenty of other “special” hotels close by, stay elsewhere.",Negative
"I recently had the opportunity to stay at this hotel and wanted to share my experience. Firstly, I noticed that I was overcharged for the boat trip that I booked through the hotel. The amount billed was significantly higher than the quoted price, which led to some confusion and inconvenience. Additionally, I experienced a couple of maintenance-related issues in my room. The air conditioning unit would not turn off, causing the room to be uncomfortably cold and resulting in a restless night. Consequently, I was awake from 4 am and had difficulty getting the rest I needed. Furthermore, the locker in my room was not functioning properly, which made securing my belongings more challenging than it should have been. These issues combined gave me the impression that the overall maintenance and hospitality at the hotel were somewhat subpar.",Negative
"Room was not ready at check in even though we arrived two hours after the check in time. No welcome drink while we waited for the room. We booked a family suite and paid 130,000 LKR for two nights. No other information was provided when we finally got to the room. No wifi details, no other general information on the room or how to operate the in room jacuzzi. When we finally did use the showers we discovered there were no towels also in the room. Overall very poor experience for a supposed 5 star hotel",Negative
"My family and I checked in to Herittance Kandalama for just one night, the overall experience was amazing until we checked out and went into cashier's office to make payments. My father made the booking via an individual by the name Indunil who works at your Hotel, he failed to communicate effectively the room rates to my father and we were in for a surprise when we checked out. Apparently we were upgraded to two suites rather than double rooms for which he sent the confirmation via whatsapp to my father. The front desk also failed to communicate this at the time of checkin and consequently we were requested to pay an extra 30,000 LKR at the end. I was absolutely furious as we were not made aware of this and a hotel of such caliber failed miserably to effectively communicate to their customer the room rates. We made the payment but left with a bitter taste. The hotel also failed to provide my wife with a band aid, that's a very simple request which the hotel failed to cater to. I would not recommend this property to my friendly and family as we felt we were deceived.",Negative
"The hotel was beautiful, restaurant staff was friendly but we had some problem with the booking and the rooms provided for us. First of all when we booked the rooms, we were only told it would be a double and triple superior, no other information was provided (view, which wing). Since this was our first time we didn't really ask for more information either. That maybe our fault I admit. However, for what we paid, we weren't fairly compensated for the rooms. 1) both the rooms were facing a car park. When we inquired about this we were told, for better views we had to pay more- which is fine but it's the hotels responsibility to inform us when we made the reservation. 2) both rooms the curtains were super dirty. They had huge black and brown stains. It looked like the curtains weren't washed in years. 3) the triple room the AC was leaking. Someone came to fix it but no one arrived to clean the mess despite informing the front desk. 4) the overall dismissive nature of the front desk staff about the complaints 5) the double room phone wasnt working. All in all it was quite apparent they had put us up in two run down rooms. I'm not sure if we were offered a lower price for the run down rooms or we paid the usual rates but were put up in run down rooms (I do think it's the latter). This was our experience and it wasn't a great one.",Negative
"poor customer service (rooms & restaurants), rude behavior, bad smell of bats, no quality foods, no free supplementary in a room, beds are not comfortable, small rooms, linens and towels are not clean enough, no food choices for kids.",Negative
"Will first start with good things because have to write serval negative things.Yes, Heritance Kandalama got one of the amazing views. It's a masterpiece of Mr. Jefry Bawa. An Iconic hotel. This is why you must go there. It's a masterpiece of Sri Lankan Architecture. However you need to think twice you only gonna pay for the view or you wanna good service with that amazing view.Faced few hiccups during my stay at this hotel from 27th April - 28th April. However Have to mention ""Vishan"" from housekeeping provided a prompt and a nice service. Kudos to him. Management must take care about this kind employees. Food is good but not good as early days. I did my comparisons according the stay i did few years ago.When I arrived I did not got any valet parking and the service is kinda rude I would say. I understand the covid situation around world however hotel must have come up with a better arrangement for this. I had to park my car in the carpark and take a long walk back to reception. I'm not gonna type my ideas here.Inside the room lots of things were missing. No iron and an iron bord, no tooth brushes or toothpaste. Room is kind a old and few places not clean enough. Noticed dirt on taps. I'm aware about the situation of the country these days. However hotel must provide a better service by upscaling the prices if they cannot afroed it at this price. However the room costed around 130 USD for half board.By the time when i place the booking, i specifically asked for late checkout and i even asked day before i check inn for the hotel. No one confirmed it to me so I thought it was provided. However on the day of checking out I was asked to checkout on time at 12 o'clock. I mentioned I asked for additional two hour late checkout. But hotel's respond wasn't good and provided only extra half an hour. Person knocked on the door at 12.20 to collect our bags. Also I felt that hotel is treating differently for foreigners. May be due to current situation of the country and Sri Lanka is Doler hungry now. After working several years outside the country this was my 1st visit after covid. Being a Sri Lankan I expected better service from Sri Lanka than this. Lots of things to improve and we will not pay only for the view. Service matters. I'm not sure I'm gonna revisit Heritance Kandalama again. Sorry about being bit hash but i mentioned what I saw and what i felt. Wish you all the very best and try to fix the things in this hotel. Don't let it die. PS: not gonna proofread again for grammar and spelling mistakes.",Negative
"We sincerely thank you Imangana for your support and dedication to your staff.But I would like to remind you of the food served at Kashyapa Restaurant and the problems with those dishes.We also express our regret that we did not receive the discount of around Rs. 100,000 due to a mistake made by the telephone operator of your hotel again, we would like to remind you that you appreciate the service and dedication of Mrs. Imangana who works in the company.l.",Negative
"I’m a Sri Lankan native and What a WASTE of money and time.I couldn’t wait to leave..my bad experience started with our reservations.We asked if we could postpone the date and keep an open reservation subject to room availability cos one of us tested positive for covid.They told us we had to come within the promotional period and absolutely no concessions were given.The thing that really ticked me off was that the reservations lady Sumaya was extremely rude, offhand, unhelpful and was not even apologetic about our situation.its fine if they cannot change the reservation but The entire time she sounded fed up and as if she was doing us a giant favor by picking up our calls! I have never experienced this kind of service with other comparable hotels.When we arrived the reception desk was friendly but then We were given a room with NO VIEWS.( and I saw plenty of empty rooms with a view over the lake)On top of that it was very dark and the lights were too dim.The room and bathroom were not very clean, there was mould in the shower head and drainage EW! it was the same in the other room we were given as well.The food wasn’t terrible but it was certainly not up to standard compared to other hotels I stayed in..and there was a poor selection..Although there were no major Incidents the staff were very unprofessional overall.I asked for a finger bowl in the restaurant ..never got it, a receptionist called at 11am and quite rudely inquired whether we were leaving at 12pm, after we had everything packed and ready especially because this person made a point of it, NO-ONE came to pick our luggage until 12.30!The views over the lake were beautiful but not worth the exorbitant prices..I don’t know whether this treatment is reserved for natives, but I would certainly never go there again. Do yourself a favor and book any one of the other big resorts nearby for 1/2 the price and enjoy your vacation..",Negative
We were very excited to visit Kandalama after 4Hour journey. Front desk offered us a different room type which we had to complaint back and get the paid room type. Had to wait about an hour extra to go to the correct room type that we booked. Lake view promised in the web site was not there. At the check out had to wait extra 90 minutes for some one to come and pick our bags although they strickly claim the room back at 12.00 noon.Never felt like home.Food was goods and out side views are very existing and refreshing.,Negative
I was so excited to try Heritance Kandalama as it was the go to hotel few years back in Sri Lanka. Still it was only regrets and disappointment from the moment I stepped into the hotel.Front office kept us waiting for almost 40 minutes and I had to go and ask for lunch as we were on full board while it was around 2.10pm. Then only they remembered to check what's our meal plan and to ask from which meal we want to start. The staff at the front office and chefs are not respectful and helpful at al but have to say that minor staff was really good and helpful.We selected the second best room category for our stay but it wasn't even clean while it was full of dust. Food was nothing to complain but would never recommend anyone to try Heritance Kandalama anymore,Negative
"We all went there for two days and as not much of a crowd first day buffet wasn’t there. However 5 course meal were presented along with some bbq and srilankan dishes unlimited (action stations) .Rooms and other amenities are quiet old however the bathroom and the view from there is spectacular (sigiriya view side) . Gym is open along with good number of equipment and there was a trainer inside just in case. There were 3 pools and only kaludiya pokuna and infinity pool were opened for guests. On the second day onwards buffet was there, however not much of a variety even though there are number of people on that day. We tend to believe that it may because of the discounts they are offering.Library was open but there were not more than 5 English books and not a single sinhala book .There was a small worm inside the muffin and when we complained to management they started asking us million questions even before they start investigating from their side. We felt like they are trying to put the blame on us by accusing we took our food outside. If the action stations are operating outside how are we supposed to bring food without taking a plate out. Nevertheless we are sure that we didn’t take pastries out and they have all the authority to watch their cctv recording a if anything. However on the day we left ( 3rd day) GM and their pastry manager met us at the departure and apologized for the inconvenience. They gave us few bottles of jam and chutney as complimentary.I took a cycle from there in the morning and got to know it costs 1000 per hour. However it wasn’t charged from my final Bill May be because of the situation we had to face during our breakfast.",Negative
"Me and husband visited the hotel with high expectations for our anniversary. The moment I stepped into the room I was confused and upset to see that it was not the room that we booked. We selected the deluxe king room because it looked cozy for us and it had a jacuzzi and a balcony. But the management had upgraded us to a suite with a separate huge living room which was unnecessary. We were grateful for the upgrade but would have appreciated it if they had informed us prior to sending us to the room. We wanted the original room we booked as we wanted a cozy room and not a huge room and also I wanted the balcony area to be there. After we requested we had to wait almost 1 1/2 hrs in the room without moving around because of the covid-19. That part we understand but the butler who came to pick up our luggage didn't even inform us that we had to got the reception to find our new room.In the new room that we got, the jacuzzi was not working properly and the remote was also not working. Plus the trip switch went off once.My husband had requested the complimentary anniversary cake to be delivered during the dinner which we didn't receive. Although a couple next to us received a cake. So when my husband talked to the management we found out that the cake was mistakenly given to the wrong couple!!! and they will send another cake to our room if we wanted one. After being upset about this we came back to our room around 9pm. At about 10.30 pm we received the cake to our room which was not how my husband wanted to surprise me.The dinner was not that great. The meat items had no salt or properly seasoned. The breakfast and lunch was average.The sceneries were really nice and the greenly effect was breathtaking. All the views from the hotel was really nice. When dining also you can get a seat closer to the window, so that you can see the lake and the surrounding while eating. The precautions for the covid-19 was properly followed.I had really high expectations of the hotel when we were coming to the place. My friends and relatives had been to this hotel for several times and they were disappointed to hear what happened to us.",Negative
"Bad: I have not so good feelings about this hotel, honestly not worth the money. I stayed in a delux room, still not maintained enough. Bath fittings are worn off, jacuzzi tub is like a public toilet, Taps and all fittings just looks terrible. Rooms doesn’t even have toothpaste, when checked they want to sell me a one in the morning 35/- worth one for 100/-. You call it luxury hotel. Bed sheets are turned white to brown white. No activities announced. Pool assistant is A kinky person staring at all woman.Good: location, views, hotel structure, pool, food is average.When compared to Jetwing hotels, Marriot, Shangrilla, etc you are just wasting your money.",Negative
"- Customer service is terrible, managers and staff are rude- Room service and other requests take over an hour - The pool did not feel clean, and the general public was allowed to take photos of the infinity pool, so no privacy for hotel guests- The rooms are dated and feel old. There are marks, stains, and scratches everywhere- Food in the restaurant is overpriced and awful, the service is appalling and the waiters didn;t know their own menu",Negative
"Wanted to stay in a iconic Geoffrey Bawa designed hotel ,and the location and styling is great.The disappointment was the lack of any atmosphere in the public areas and the buffet restaurant feels slightly like a cafeteria, noisy and food very average compared with other hotels in Sri Lanka of a similar price",Negative
"We were taken there by our tour guide, saying it's exclusive with a view. We didn't get our promised deluxe jacuzzi at first night, replaced with ""panoramic"" one was just as tired, monkeys trying to get in, the view was nothing special. Next day upgrade jacuzzi room was even worse, unclean bath added.Another shocking surprise was the prices of spa services, ca 90$ per 45 min massage! Maybe affordable for crowds of Chinese tourists.. Two hotel pools are crowded.But the restaurant and the food are good!",Negative
"The view and atmosphere here were incredible, we were celebrating our anniversary and the views from our balcony were just fantastic. We loved just watching the monkeys in the trees by other room and the sunrise was a massively highlight.The food was also very good, although a little hectic in the dining area and everyone trying to make the most of the buffet.When we arrived we were asked to leave our bags so they could check them, which is understandable after recent events, but they had no idea whose bags belonged to which room. After an hour of waiting we still didn’t have our bags so we went reception to tell the staff which bags were ours, it just seemed a little disorganised. Also when we were shown to our room, there were a few mattresses lying in the corridors, it didn’t give a positive start in this is a 5 star hotel. The staff didn’t seem as attentive as the other hotels that we stayed in, we just seemed like a number and all that was cared about was money. The excursions were really highly priced, we just found a driver on trip advisor for half the price and he was really good. The room was ok, but no good tea options and we could hear the couple in the room next to ours, not something that you should have to hear when you are trying to relax and enjoy. I feel you could get a nicer hotel for a better cost.",Negative
"This is supposed to be ""the"" resort to be at in Sri Lanka, and the food they offer is mediocre. I've had better at resorts in Malaysia. They charged me 3800Rs for the buffet dinner per person upon check out but the night before they had said it would be 3500Rs - it's not a big difference but, out of principle, unjust. The drinks are not included! The place is nice but gets boring, so don't stay more than two days - we stayed four. They don't have fun things to do in the area.",Negative
"I really wanted to love this hotel. We had spent a bit more money as a treat stay on our holiday but sadly it was disappointing as soon as we walked through the door, mainly because it’s not our cup of tea.Positives- lovely location with good views and probably quite nice for families-the staff are very nice as they are in most of the hotels-the design of the hotel from the outside is great and there is lots of wildlife aroundNegatives- the cost to get to sigiriya rock was 7000 Rupees quoted by the hotel so it’s not close at all, despite looking so on the map.- the hotel was huge so lacked any personal touch. It took ages to walk around from place to place. It reminded us of a cheap all inclusive hotel you often see abroad. Not our style at all.- the thing that annoyed us more than anything was the prices when you get there. You’re in the middle of no where so have no option but to buy from the hotel. Despite having stayed in much nicer places in Sri Lanka, the prices they asked here were phenomenal. Shockingly expensive. They were quoting 2-3 times the prices for excursions than if you go out of the hotel and the food and drinks when you’re there are the same. Don’t get me started on the spa, it was more expensive than luxury spas in the UK! For me this makes a mockery of the tourists that visit and that’s something I really don’t agree with.I wouldn’t go again and wouldn’t recommend this hotel to a friend.",Negative
"I made a reservation at Heritance Kandalama for my honey-moon (honey-moon package). But the experience was not satisfying.I'm entitled for a chocolate platter and a fruit platter. But it was not provided at the room. I had to remind the staff in the evening and only then they brought it to the room. Also the presence of the fruit platter and chocolate platter was not good. Instead of a nice chocolate platter, we got a small ""Mars"" chocolate bar (face palm). I have seen chocolate platters of other hotels and they look much nicer and quality.Also we are entitled for a sundown cocktail. But when I asked in the evening, they said they can only provide a mocktail (oh common ... :( ).So not a good lace for your honey-moon.No standard power outlets in room which I could connect my laptop or mobile phone charger.Pool was not much clean. Also I could see frogs in the pool. It's acceptable since the hotel is based on a forest area. But it could have been cleaner.Food was ok. Appetisers salad was good. Staff was good and friendly.",Negative
"welcoming not their, bit slow in serving specially customers travelling from distance, waited for the service too long. Restaurant or buffet nothing special, room neat and cleanses, amenities provided, good security around and inside, room service was excellent and lighting not adequate to light up the hotel ghost look.",Negative
"Our stay was ok, but not at the level we expected. I know we got a discount rate when reserving the rooms but that doesn't mean Heritance Kandalama is going to lower their services right? Environment was great.Food was ok, but lots of repetitive menu items were there (Lot of flies were there as well in the buffet area).Customer service level was ok (Understandable with lot of guests in the hotel).Though we requested toothbrush & toothpaste, we didn't get any.Overall room quality is poor, need serious refurbishment (refer images).",Negative
"We visited this hotel to have a look at the building and have lunch. Maybe the service for in house guests is good, but DO NOT COME HERE as a visitor. The staff's behaviour is condescending and arrogant, making the whole experience awkward and unpleasant. You can not really see the building, and you are not allowed to use the pool (not for a charge either) or come just for a drink or food. Maybe the place is beautiful, but the service most definitely isn't.",Negative
"This hotel has an amazing position and the outlook is absolutely stunning. We paid for a deluxe spa room and the room was OK, but very tired and you get a lot more for the same money in major western cities.We only stayed for one night, but we found the service terrible in comparison to the other places we’ve stayed in Sri Lanka. For example- we waited so long (over 30mins) for our bags to come to our room, we ended up going to get them from reception ourselves as they were still sitting down there- it took us 2hrs to have an evening meal while we saw others come in, eat and leave the restaurant. After waiting 20+ mins with empty plates on our table I actually had to go up to ask for the bill so we could leave.They seem to have heaps of staff floating around but not doing much and this was a major let down for the price paid.Glad we stayed, but I definitely wouldn’t stay again & if I knew how terrible the service would be we wouldn’t have booked.",Negative
"Kandalama is an amazing hotel that has fallen into despair. The Hotel itself is amazing, the views, location etc. The staff are the friendliest staff we've met so far, extremely polite and courteous. Food is amazing, just love the taste and varieties. However, that's all that's there to like.The rooms are okay, but are in desperate need of repair and maintenance. The door doesn't even offer the basic function expected of a door, and you can see in and out from the cracks around the door. This also meant that we could hear everything happening outside down to the noise of a person sweeping the compound. Rooms aren't soundproof either, you can literally hear the sounds of other people flushing their toilets. Not a pleasant sound!! TV, minibar etc are extremely out of date; the minibar is noisy!! Also, the bathroom fittings are yellowed, especially the tub and commode. We therefore didn't even use the tub. Not at all what you'd expect from a 5 star hotel.Finally, although we were treated extremely well when checking in, the check out process makes you feel as if they're just throwing you out, as opposed to the warm check out process of similar class hotels such as The Hilton, The Grand Kandyan etc. Really need to improve on this, since this is the step that makes a customer consider coming again.",Negative
"Booked two superior rooms. It is just okay. There is nothing special about the place. Having a meal is better if you want to visit the property. There was an ant in my hot dog and I was charged for the replacement. Service is less than average. Maybe it could be the language. Per me, it is not worth the money.",Negative
Staff were very friendly. Clean rooms. Showers were very weird with one main shower head from the roof of shower. Difficult to shower. Hotel is very big. Need to walk alot to the restaurant. Lighting in the room was very poor.,Negative
"First impressions were not good when arrived. Especially after all the other places we stayed at in Sri Lanka excelled at customer service. There was a mix up with our booking, and instead of resolving the issue professionally, they were rude and abrupt. They offered us an ""upgrade"" to a suite, which was old, run down and not cleaned properly or maintained at all. The shower had a disgusting amount of calcium build up.The restaurant food quality was also disappointing. The food was cold, and not at all flavorsome. Again, we experienced much better food in every other place we stayed at.Then to top it all off, my wife slipped and hurt her wrist quite bad (It was swollen so much we thought it could have been fractured) the hotel gave us a bandage to wrap it, but not once did they check in on us to see how she was feeling.All in all, I would never stay here again, nor would I recommend this hotel to anyone. They made us feel like a burden from the get go. If they expect people to fork out the money for their ""5 star hotel"" they have a lot to change.",Negative
I know for sure that when this hotel was launched 25 yrs ago it was spectacular. Bold architecture. Big and innovative. And that still shows. But that was 25 years back and after winning all awards untill 2006 it got silent after that. And i believe it got no renovation ever since. And that is what we experienced. It still lives on its old reputation. But it turned into a mass tourist proposition. Mass food. One restaurant only which is an avarage buffet. And staff that acts pretty arrogant. And all together quite expensive. No 5 Star worth anymore. And compared to what booking.com promised for us a dissapointing visit.,Negative
"The place truly has so much potential, with a phenomenal setting and great proximity to many attractions including Sigiriya and many national park safaris. However, service is awful and it seems like a burden on the waiters to be serving you. The chef and sous chef were delightful and accomodating of food allergies. Despite these few exceptions the staff moved very slowly and overall service was bad. There are nicer hotels in the area - pick one of those!",Negative
"Front Office staff unfriendly and they dont know how to treat guests and i must say the buffet are very rich and foods are great,We enjoyed the food very much.There was a fabulous choice of foods. Rooms are Old anf little dark.",Negative
The design of this hotel is amazing and definitely worth a visit. However the customer service of the front desk staff is very poor. One night is just enough to explore the hotel surrounding. Food is average.,Negative
"We had high expectations of this hotel but were very disappointed. For a 5* hotel a buffet restaurant was not what we expected however the food was good and varied. The staff were polite too.The main problem was our room number 507 which was on the end of the corridor with a pungent air conditioning smell. We complained twice only for the housekeeper to spray apple freshener and leave. You weren’t allowed to open the windows because the monkeys would come into your room. So in the end we had to sleep without air conditioning and boiled all night.Monkeys - room 507 is on the route to the roof and our outside table was used by them to bounce off to the next balcony. Interesting to see but very noisy.Personally for a 5* hotel it’s tired, needs updating and soulless. Good for big groups but not the getaway for us.",Negative
"We travelled here as a couple on an extended trip. It's safe to say this was one of the parts of our trip that we were most excited about.Since arriving the staff were friendly and accommodating. The rooms were lovely, immaculate and really felt that you were a part of nature. During our 3-day stay we had a great time and really loved the 3 pools available to us. We also ate in the hotel and the evening buffet was good value.Unfortunately, the reason I've had to give this otherwise amazing hotel such a low rating is that early in our stay we saw an elephant bathing in the water. On closer inspection it was very clear that the elephant was chained up. My partner went for an early morning run in the area and came across the elephant picking up her chain and throwing it repeatedly, as if she was frustrated and upset. After seeing wild elephants, it was heartbreaking to see such a beautiful animal in this context and clearly distressed.You'll see this has been mentioned on prior reviews and whilst the welfare of this elephant may not be directly under the hotel's jurisdiction - they must accept a wider responsibility especially if guests are being sold elephant rides. We loved this ""eco-friendly"" hotel but would not return because of this. Sorry.",Negative
"We booked a standard room and the agent who handle my booking suggested to book a panoramic room for few extra bucks. So I booked the panoramic room because in the Kanadalam hotel official web site photos of the panoramic room look pretty awesome. But when I visited my first thought was that I was in the wrong room. So I called the reception and ask that “are we in the correct room?” They confirm that we are in a panoramic room. I couldn’t see any panoramic view from that room. Half of the view was blocked by some vegetation. Which was ok from another prospective. But the sole purpose of the panoramic room fails. Tidiness of the room was ok but when I saw the inside of the electric kettle I was shocked. My wife tries to make a tea and when we see inside the kettle it was not washed properly for ages I guessed. Then the funniest part of my whole tripe. They ask guests to wear smart casual for dinner buffet. But I wasn’t brought any trousers but ¾ shorts. They didn’t let me in to the restaurant with my ¾ shorts and offer me a sarong because my short didn’t cover my legs from knee cap to ankle.  And until that moment I didn’t know sarong and t-shirt considered as smart casual  . According to my view we go on a trip to get relaxed. No restrictions no rules. But in Kandalama I feel I was invited to some kind of dinner party with a dress code. I saw many guests either wore sarong or go back to the room and get dressed with trouser. I don’t get what they try to achieve by introducing such dress code rule to dinner buffet. It’s pointless, we pay to stay but hotel thinks that they are giving free food if we dress according to their rules. I was really humiliated in front of other guests because of that dress changing. Don’t we have any right to wear what we want???? If you wear a swimming short or any under garments to a restaurant, that is of course not appropriate. But regular shorts???????????? We really disappointed with the hotel management who introduce such rules. But food was so delicious and restaurant staff was good.",Negative
"We have stayed for a week at this hotel two years ago and it was very good so I was looking forward to a week here this year . It didn’t take long for us to realise that things have changed , upon arrival , after a 20 hr journey we were seated in an idyllic place with beautiful views across the lake , perfect I thought I just wanted to enjoy the moment, we were offered a fruit drink, unfortunately it was undrinkable it was horrible, I mentioned this and was told to put syrup in it , I did , horrible still undrinkable , I asked for a cup of tea , tea was the response , you’d think I’d asked for a rare whisky , considering this is a tea growing country the response was awful, apparently it’s not the normal thing to do until after you’ve been taken to your room , the week played out very much like this with similar situations , room too far away from everything, restaurant staff unhelpful and appeared miserable, the only good thing about this hotel is the views , pool area not landscaped and no shade , other pools disgusting I wouldn’t even dip a toe in , main pool freezing cold not relaxing and no pool bar you have to walk back into hotel , not a 4/ 5 star not worth the price they charge , maybe ok for 1/2 nights but no way a week",Negative
"I first came here about five years ago. Or was it yesterday? This place has not changed one iota in the meantime. It’s so tired in so many respects that I don’t feel it would be of value to spell them out. Just assume everything needs an upgrade.Staff seem like they are in a daze, and at least gave us some moments of genuine comedy. Service levels are so far below the 5 stars the hotel somehow commands, that it’s best to just see the funny side. The hotel is simply milking the captive market of tourists coming for the local delights, of which there are many. If you’re ok with that you will probably have a perfectly good time. And on the plus side, it’s got great views, lots of naughty monkeys and .... oh, that’s it.",Negative
i found this hotel very disappointing.having to watch the poor elephant all day long doing rides with whole families on her back and in chains and with a spike at her neck was incredibly sad. the hotel tried to say it had nothing to do with the elephant but then had to come clean when i said you actually advertise it on your tvs in the room.The rooms were very average when you can hear the toilet being flushed from room above and the loud spa noise just drove us mad.,Negative
"The Heritance Kandalama is a special hotel and a place to enjoy in a spectacular setting. The hotel is the masterpiece of Geoffrey Bawa and it is a very large facility. Our room was a large suite and it was decorated attractively. However, it was also furnished in one of the most uncomfortable furniture selections imaginable. Our bed was large but also sported the hardest mattress around which made sleeping a problem. Our room and bathroom were both in desperate need of being redone. There were sloppy paint splotches, rust, and generally furnishings that may have been in style 30+ years ago. Breakfasts have a large array of food and it covers anything and everything that one could possibly want. But like dinner, it is served in a very large room that has a cafeteria feel to it. The view was impressive, but the windows were dirty and marked with thousands of bugs. Although we tend to enjoy smaller hotels, the Heritance Kandalama could possibly be a great hotel, but it needs major work.",Negative
"Kandalama is has a unique setting. Location is amazing. However, the room and bathroom amenities are not in great condition. Our bathroom had a bad smell that was unbearable. This hotel needs some renovations. Not worth the money.",Negative
"We booked our room on full board basis on 31st December 2017. When we entered to the restaurant for the 31st nigh dinner, Assistant F&B Manager treated us in a very bad way. He asked whether we have reserved a table. If we booked the room on full board basis, do we have to reserve tables? And after that he didn’t even look at us. The hall was crowded with guests (most of them are the visitors of hotel staff). We were taken to a table where we faced to a rock. The band and all the happenings were behind us. We made the complaint to the duty manager that night and he said he’ll do the needful. But the next day Asst. F&B Manager was there at the restaurant but he didn’t even say sorry. We asked his name (because we needed to write a review), then only he said sorry. We came to Heritance Kandalama hotel from Uga Jungle Beach. We saw a very contrastive difference of the service when comparing to Uga Jungle Beach.",Negative
We had great expectations for this hotel and so we're thoroughly disappointed as the noise and large numbers of noisy children continuously interfered with the peaceful environment. We were hoping to use the infinity pool but could not because of all the children playing games and noise. Don't come here at a weekend,Negative
"Given the recommendations, We were thoroughly looking forward to our stay at this ""tranquil and luxurious hotel "" imagine our disappointment to find that we have been continually disturbed by excessively loud discos held in their function room until after midnight and poor customer service to respond to the issue by the duty manager. I would not recommend this hotel to any travellers that wish to sleep before midnight. Positives, great architecture and setting, with good proximity to many of the cultural triangle attractions. A word of caution, the Restaurants are quite basic with the main restaurant having a limited menu to cater for dietary requirements and staff that get flustered if busy. A disappointing way to spend our wedding anniversary, Sadly not a 5 star experience",Negative
"We had been looking forward to staying in this much recommended hotel for 3 nights and ended up thoroughly disappointed. It is in a beautiful location and the infinity pool is picturesque. However the whole hotel is incredibly loud. Our rooms were on the 3rd floor opposite the service area. The noise started at 7 am and because the accoustics are really poor and the standard rooms have the beds right next to the doors, the noise woke all of us up. Adding to that there was a function room 2 floors down from us and on the last night I woke up around midnight to intolerable levels of noise coming from there. 2 calls to reception and it stopped after 30 mins. The duty manager apologised the next day, but thats not really helping anyone at that point.Aside from the noise issues, the rooms were small and due to the monkeys being a strong feature around the hotel you could not open the doors for any length of time or leave anything outside. The bathrooms had seen better days and smelled musty, the trip to the dining hall was way too lengthy, the dining hall itself had the charm of a work cantine (although nice views) and was very noisy too. On the first night we could not get a table for 30 mins since it was very busy.The pools dont have enough sun loungers and the 2 other pools apart from the infinity one are distinctly average. The a-la -carte restaurant on the 7th floor was lacking any kind of atmosphere.When we complained, the staff showed a very complacent attitude.",Negative
"I had high expectations of the hotel before arriving; unfortunately, it turned out to be a huge disappointment. The room conditions definitely need an overhaul - everything from plumbing to flooring. I thought it was pure exaggeration by other reviewers when they mentioned mud coming out of faucets... turned out to be true.For a resort that's trying to be green, there is still alot of room for improvement. For starters, stop providing complimentary drinking water in PET bottles. Do what other green resorts do - provide clean filtered water in reusable glass containers. Instead of burning diesel fuels to generate electricity, try using renewable energy generators such as wind turbines or solar panels. Nothing is more depressing than waking up to the smell of diesel fumes.The food as well as the service is mediocre. I usually had to ask for water 3 times in the restaurant before being served; it's strange because there are plenty of waitors/waitress walking around. One thing I also noticed at this hotel is that all the staff, including the ones at the receptionist, seemed quite demoralized. When they see you, instead of a nod and/or smile, they simply stare at you as if you aren't really welcomed here.This is definitely one of the most underwhelming 5-star resorts I've been to.",Negative
"This hotel is unusual and has some lovely features, particularly the vines draping in front of the windows with monkeys and birds perched on the balconies. Room cleaning crews were spot on but sadly the furnishings are looking run down and could do with updating. Woodwork is looking rough.The restaurant has a good choice but on our first evening a child threw up on the floor near our table and waiting staff did not even clear it up, allowed the sick child and family to stay and return to buffet and put a linen napkin on the floor over the vommit! A complete disaster for cross contamination. We were appalled and left. Two days later there was a mouse in the restaurant!We felt the whole place lacked a sense of pride and was a real tourist bus factory!We tried to use the swimming pools but there were no chairs let alone sunbeds. The poolside was just mud.This was the most expensive hotel on our 21 day itinerary on a private Sri Lankan tour, it was definitely the worst.",Negative
"This is a five star hotel based on reputation alone. I would give the setting and design five stars; however, it has become quite run-down due to a lack of care by staff and management. Our room was dirty. The windows hadn't been washed in sometime. Mirrors had spots, smudges and streaks. The shower had calcium and lime buildup; sink had not been properly wiped down....The main pool is ok, again, nice views, but is not big enough to accommodate the number of guests. The second pool doesn't even boast the nice views. It's crowded and noisy most of the afternoon and evening.We also felt cheated when we arrived to find out that we had to pay a 30% gratuity and tax charge in addition to the charge of the room that we had already paid. We ate at the a la carte restaurant in order to dodge the buffet crowd. The food was great! Upon checkout we were charged 29% charges again. So basically all prices listed here are just 3/4 of the real price. We don't mind paying, but it's good to know prices ahead of time. We were only able to stay one night because it was already booked through most of our stay in Dambulla. The other time we stayed at the Jetwing Lake, and it was far superior and was truly a five star hotel at a third of the price of the Heritance. My suggestion to anyone who is considering this hotel: don't do it. Stay at another hotel (I suggest Jetwing.)This hotel is overrated.",Negative
We had booked it for three nights but only stayed two. This place has a few nice pools one that is infinity and backs onto the lake. The surroundings of the hotel is beautiful as you are set in the jungle (lots of bugs and bees nests as to be expected). We stayed here because we wanted to climb The Lion Rock and since we knew there is not hole like to do around we booked one of the sweets that have a spa so we could overlook the jungle whilst reading and relaxing. The cost of booking a suit instead of a room was substantially more however we thought we would pay the extra to enhance the experience. On the second night we decided to fill the spa and much to my disgust all brown sludge came out of the jets and lots of bugs which clearly indicated had not been back washed or cleaned properly from the previous guests. It was pretty dirty in general and considering what we had paid I was eXpecting a little bit more. When we checked out the next day the gentleman said he was sorry and that he would look into it and to be honest he didn't seem very phased when he left I spoke to the Cachia and explain to him that we had paid so much extra to have a spa that we could not use and we are leaving a day early which we knew was not refundable they then decided to give me $50 off which is a huge disappointment considering we spent hundreds extra to have that suit. The spa and staff were amazing highly recommend to get a massage. This place is fine to stay whilst climbing the rock I wouldn't be here too long however it's a great spot for kids with huge pools. If you climb the Rock I highly advise that you leave the hotel at 6 AM to be there at 7sharp we missed all of the queues and the traffic when we were coming down we could not believe how many people were there it was chaos ( skip breakkie or order an omelette to eat before you go in your room as buffet open at 6)Overall could have been cleaner !!,Negative
"This hotel is a real disappointment. The breakfast in the morning looked stale and dinner was average.The walls in the hotel all need a refreshing of paint as it all feels slightly grubby. There are no where near enough pool sun loungers for the amount of guests and several guests were just putting towels on the concrete. Whilst the hotel states it has three pools, one of them has a ""rocky"" style floor making it hard to swim in or even walk in.The room was the least of our problems and still it was not quite clean, we had tears in the curtains and lights that didn't work making the room very dark.We tried to get our money back and move hotels but we couldn't - a room upgrade really didn't change much.I wouldn't stay here if you are looking for a relaxing, luxury get away.",Negative
"We spent a night at the famous Heritance Kandalama to celebrate my birthday. The location of the hotel is in the jungle overlooking a lake. Here’s the list of pros and cons. The Pros: 1) The Room - The room (Panoramic Room) was nicely decorated to complement and blend with nature. The ceiling-high windows in the bedroom and toilet, allows you to enjoy the lush greenery forest view.2) Room Service - As there were no nearby restaurants (traveller tip: if you want to save, buy food and snacks beforehand), we decided to dine-in. Our dinner was delivered on time and so did our breakfast.3) The Food: We decided to try a little bit of each category on the menu and everything ordered was delicious and did not let us down.The Cons:The Room: In its glory days, we can envision Heritance Kandalama to be the hotel of choice for a serene and beautiful experience. It is easier to build something than it is to maintain and sustain it. Every item in the room looked like it was poorly maintained or the management decided to just use cheap quick-fix solutions rather than trying to uphold the high standards it was initially built for.Special Request - As it was a birthday celebration, my husband requested complimentary arrangements to be made during our stay. Unfortunately, this was the only hotel in our Sri Lanka trip that either overlooked or totally ignored the request.Mosquitoes, mosquitoes, mosquitoes! - Being one with nature, it is understandable for there to be many insects roaming around. However, it would be nice if the hotel ensured no insects in the room before checking us in. We requested an insect repellent spray from housekeeping to exterminate at least a dozen mosquitoes inside our room and probably a hundred (yes, 100+) at the balcony. We were looking forward to watch the sunset from the balcony, however, it just didn’t seem worth the risk of contracting mosquito-borne diseases on your holiday.Value for money - The dine-in was a little pricey compared to other hotels (including Galle Face Hotel in Colombo). The price of the room itself would have been justified had it not been for the very poor maintenance.",Negative
"We stayed here 5 years ago and loved it, so decided to return again and it was a mistake. The staff who were friendly, attentive, and helpful, and the food, which was a huge choice and delicious. Both our rooms were very bad, smelly, the bathroom and toilet had grubby, old, disgusting stains all over it. We were so fed up with the hotel we couldn't wait to get out.",Negative
"After hearing so much about this architectural masterpiece of Bawa, we decided to take time off from work for a weekend getaway at this hotel.Check in process was smooth but the welcome drink they offered us was horrible.Bed was not as comfortable as we expected. The air conditioning didn't work properly we had to switch on the fan as well.Being a luxury room and a five star facility, we expected them to provide us with the most basics such as tooth brushes and tooth paste. Glass panels of the shower cubicles were covered with stains. Toilet bowl was nothing different.Lunch and dinner buffets were so disappointing. Same dishes were offered at both the meals. However, the breakfast spread was good.Overall, our experience at this hotel was so bad that I couldn't wait to leave the place.",Negative
"We booked this hotel via booking.com and looking at the photos we were expecting an exceptional stay. Although the photos do not correspond to reality and it actually turned out to be the worst stay of our vacation.What stays positive is the location and the views but that's it.The hotel is dated, I can see how it would be amazing 5 years ago, but current state does not hold a 5 star standard. The rooms are very disappointing: bed uncomfortable, bathroom mold on shower curtain and scotch to hold up mirror. Any rooms in Dambulla wing for floor 3-5 have very poor views,barley see the lake. You can also see the road to get to the hotel, along comes the noice of the cars. Pool areas are crowded and with a limited number of chairs (I would estimate 40). Restaurant bathroom extremely poor.Secondly we experienced the service as selective depending on who you are with exception to some staff, especially cleaning staff. The bare minimum is not achieved in terms of service: a smile.Thirdly, the food and the restaurant feels like a canteen. There is a lot of choice but unfortunately it only holds up to an average. Grab a table outside if you want to improve the experience, otherwise just crowded and noisy.We choice this hotel based on good reviews by lonely planet and booking.com but I do not believe this hotel deserves the credit it has been given. And it's definitely not worth the price.",Negative
"Beautifully-designed /- located hotel close to Sigirya. Lovely views from the hotel across the lake. Friendly, professional and polite staff. Good selection of food at both breakfast and dinner. Unfortunately all of this was spoilt by the room. We booked a 'panoramic' room and therefore expected a view of the surrounding area. The room overlooked the lake but certainly wasn't panoramic. It was also situation above the power generator for the hotel : rather than listening to 'nature' sat on our balcony, all we could hear was the whirring of the generator. The staff quickly responded to my request to change rooms, apparently upgraded us, and we moved to a room looking at the trees. A very pleasant room, though as soon as we opened the balcony door, we were attacked by an aggressive monkey (for which we obviously can't blame the hotel !) who was after the fruit on the table in the room. At dinner, when the manager introduced himself, I relayed my dissatisfaction to him,. He said he would come back to me that evening. He was there again at breakfast, and when I asked him for some feedback, he said he'd been too busy. He then went off to make a phone call and came back to explain that, yes we had been given a panoramic room and yes we had been subsequently upgraded. I felt I'd been misled, either by the glowing descriptions on the hotel website or by the manager. Either way, we left feeling disappointed...... which was a shame as everything else was excellent.",Negative
"This hotel could be very good, but has been disappointing due to a number of basic problems, which should not exist in a hotel of this standard. The design of the hotel was very good, by a well known Architect, but little has been done to provide modern hospitality and services. The lobby bar is small and dark and the upper lounges are not serviced by staff offering drinks or snacks. Some areas are empty of guests with no atmosphere. It seemed as if nothing was being done to manage the care of guests.The glass balcony doors and outside furniture were dirty in our room. The housekeeper came to clean them, after our complaint, but left only cleaning the glass door and not the table and chairs. In the end we had to do that ourselves.The door seal was poor and with no lobby to the room, any noise from the corridor was very disturbing at night. Our room was under the restaurant and noises from tables and chairs also disturbed us in the early morning.The deluxe room included a jacuzzi with an overhead rain shower, but the design made it very difficult to get in and out onto a narrow step. Water from the shower did not drain away from around the top of the bath making the area wet all the time, dripping onto the bathroom floor.There was a sign in the lobby explaining the dress code for one of the restaurants. Many guests ignored it and were left in shorts and tee shirts in the main restaurant. If you are bother to have dress code, then enforce it or remove it.The private road to the hotel was full of potholes, making a long bumpy journey at least twice a day.On a positive note, the food was good and the staff friendly and helpful. The views out onto the lake and hills was the best feature of the hotel.Overall we left feeling dissatisfied. The management need to see what other hotels are providing and start looking after their guests.",Negative
"Kandalama used to be one of the wonders of the hospitality world. A jungle oasis seemingly conjured into existence at the intersection of lake, mountain and tree, replete with the lumbering of elephants, troupes of monkeys, birds too numerous to count, exquisite service, food and views; simple but luxurious rooms which transported you into the heart of the wilderness and, most importantly, the feeling that you were one with the jungle. I have stayed at Kandalama many times over the last 15 years; most recently in December 2014. So, you can only imagine the shock to my system, having returned to a place which I proclaimed, for those 15 years, and with complete certitude, was my favourite place in the whole world, has become, at best, a 3 star hotel, and at worst, an abandoned theme park. ROOMS.The rooms have deteriorated profoundly. The toilet in our first room (4XX, Sigirya Wing) stopped working on NYE. The management quickly transferred us to a suite in the Dambulla Wing (627) which looked like it hadn't been used for years. The shower reeked, making the whole room smell, the floor was dirty, the sheets dusty, the wallpaper was peeling and the furniture scuffed and sad. Thr management again transferred us to another suite, this time in the Sigirya Wing (516), which had a stunning view, was relatively clean (the shower had a number of streaks in it) but, importantly, didn't stink.The bottom line, despite the relatively quick transfers is that we wasted 3 hours on NYE.It's clear that nobody has trained the staff to comb over the rooms with a fine toothed comb, as is the baseline for any 5 star hotel. Even a simple sniff test would have sufficed to avoid the issues with our second room.The rooms (even 516) are dated beyond belief and lack even the basic trappings of a 5 star hotel, let alone a luxury 5 star hotel, which Kandalama (or, at least its pricing) suggests itself as being.FOOD.Apart from the buffet on NYE, which was at least a visually spectacular spread, taking up what appeared to be an entire ballroom, the food is nowhere near as good as it used to be. Burnt hoppers, tepid curries and sad troughs of other foods are not what I remember eating here.Someone needs to come in and apply some basic quality control. SERVICE.Apart from a few exceptions (eg Dhiran and his colleague at the front desk, the housekeepers, the restaurant manager and the massage therapists, particularly Anapum who manages them), the service lacked care, was often lazy, frequently careless (the reception lounge is particularly poor, both in terms of speed and attitude) and has simply lost its charm.Sn example: we arrived at dinner in NYE (hours late, because of the fiasco with our rooms) to discover that, despite paying 225AUD for a 35AUD bottle of champagne (Mumm) in order to secure a table by the window but away from the band, we had been placed literally next to the drummer. We were then moved next to the stairs until the restaurant manager intervened with the good common sense to move us out onto the lawn.The hotel manager paid lip service to the issues we had faced with our rooms, and blithely pointed out that the hotel was to be refurbished soon, as though that would somehow help soothe the fact that I had already wasted my money. We were given two jars of jam and some water on our way out, presumably as an apology for the issues we had faced. Both her response and the jars were unbelievably tone deaf - I had paid over 2,000AUD for the two nights we stayed at Kandalama. One would have thought that a rather more significant offer of compensation might have made sense.BOTTOM LINEUnless a mammoth amount of refurbishment and training is undertaken, I will not be staying at Kandalama, and I will be actively recommending others that they stay elsewhere.The oasis I once knew is no more, and I rate what is left a massive waste of money, and simply bad value.The jungle has taken over.",Negative
"we stayed here for 2 days for FB basis. from the arrival we experienced this unprofessional service from the staff. we received a poor welcome which was not experienced in other Heritance hotels we have visited. Room is not well prepared and we had to inquire about bathrobes, slippers and toiletries. we gathered that restaurant staff also not acting in professional manner and showed discrimination toward local guest and showed some favor toward foreign guests.he hotel was well architect by Geoffrey Bawa. but this place need serious refurbishment to meet its reputation. foods are ok at the buffet but their set menu is very cheap and has very little choices.Rooms are gloomy and old fashioned. continues buzzing of air conditioner was very uncomfortable to sleep.",Negative
I heard that food is amazing and got lots of recommendation about the food. And I visited there on 28/10/2016 full board basis. I am very disappointed about the buffet and nothing to select there. And I had to wait 30 minutes in the lobby without any guidance and even a welcome drink or welcome lotus(I have seen they gave it to some guests who came before us and after us). In the pool side there were thousands of giant ants. Can't even step out from the pool. Pool assistant didn't take any action to clean that.,Negative
"We splurged on one night on this beautiful hotel, however, upon arrival there was an issue with our booking (through agoda.com which apparently often has issues). We waited to check in for approximately an hour before being told that we would have to spend a lot more to get a room and the ""customer service manager"" implied that we had intentionally given the wrong booking details to try to skimp on the price. He was incredibly rude, rolled his eyes at me 4 times whilst I tried to explain while we were upset and then told me we should be grateful we were only being charged a bit more, rather than a lot more. We received no understanding or apology until, finally, I asked for an apology and received a very insincere one. We were very upset.on the other hand, the location is absolutely beautiful. It's hidden away with barely another building in sight. It's surrounded by a beautiful lake, the view of which is taken advantage of by the rooms and the 3 swimming pools.",Negative
"Stayed here for 3 nights of 'luxury' before our travelling trip around Sri Lanka. Booked because of the amazing trip advisor reviews. We paid almost £700 for 3 nights full board (inclusive of the additional 30% tax they add on). I was drawn to the incredible photos on the Internet of the hotel and this is why we booked to stay here. But having stayed here, I don't understand how other people are raving about this weird hotel. The architecture is impressive and the wildlife too! The buffet food is acceptable but much to choose from. The presentation is also ok but since I am paying London prices I would have liked to see more of a selection and better presentations. I got food poisoning and was violently sick from the rice on my second day, so that wasn't fun. There is no atmosphere or ambiance to this very big and bare hotel. There are only 14 deck chairs around the main pool area (which is muddy and not clean). The hotel did not feel clean enough. The main hotel, Windows, floors, our bathroom and communal areas were either greasy, dirty, dusty. There is no where to sit at night apart from a weird lobby upstairs. There is an indoor bar area which nobody sits in because there's no atmosphere and the seating area is hard and unwelcoming. At night we like to sit outside and have a drink, there is nowhere to do this! After dinner we would go back to our room because there's nothing to do. Overall this hotel is charging high 5 star European prices but offering 3 star service, atmosphere, quality and facilities. They didn't even ask for our feedback when we checked out like most hotels which suggests they don't care and just want your money. Big shame, the hotel has the potential to be excellent. I don't think the hotel management care enough. Would not recommend.",Negative
"In short, I would not return to this hotel. The hotel itself is fantastic as are the surroundings. The staff is very professional and helpful. However... the hotel is placed right at the shores of the Kandalama Reservoir, yet the only option to explore the lake is to book a 1hr guided trip on a old barge. When we stayed it was too hot to explore temples (with the kids) so we used the fantastic pool. But without any shades this became a sort of struggle. The staff told me that they don't have shades because it is an ecofriendly hotel (?!). We were also told not to roam around the woods around the hotel as there might be wild elephants... while cattle farmers were walking around frequently. Horse riding was not available any more (would be fantastic at the lakeshores), instead they offered a short trip on an elephant. Bottom line, the ecofeeling was limited to watch from a distance, whereas options to experience it personally were quite limited. Not my type of ecotourism. What a waste.",Negative
"Heritance Kandalama was the brainchild of the eccentric Sri Lankan Geoffrey Bawa whose ""tropical minimalism"" was at one time deeply fashionable but now seems rather passe. One of the first of the so called eco hotels, it also has the dubious distinction of being the world's longest. It's very austere with acres of wasted space designed by an architect who forgot that a building is generally lived in by people.The hotel has a wonderful setting overlooking the lake although it's difficult to access and because the hotel is miles from anywhere, the guests are trapped in this architectural nightmare. Service and food are OK and the staff friendly but it's very austere and you walk miles for a drink or a swim.Yet another drawback are the hotel monkeys who while fun to watch are not immune from removing your cashew nuts and Green and Black chocolates, so make sure the doors to your balcony are well locked.The Cultural Triangle is a must but unless you have a particular desire to stay in a hotel that might have been designed by a demented Marxist architect I'd avoid Heritance Kandalama.However if ugly minimalst buildings pull your rope make sure you get a room with a view over the lake.This hotel was not our first choice!",Negative
"We stayed here on a long trip through Sri Lanka, and despite the touted Geoffrey Bawa design it felt as if we were in anoverly designed and soulless corporate center. Our room (a suite) was lovely, but the long rock lined concrete corridors were unfriendly and cold feeling. The food options were dismal.Choice between an overpriced buffet and an overpriced and odd a la carte menu. Nothing at all in between. Nowhere to get snacks. Only provided two small bottles of water - if you wanted more had to order from room service. The buffet room was huge, chaotic, and unpleasant. It felt like what I imagine a crowded cruise ship would be like. Dinners were anything but relaxing. (And the food wasn't very good but there were no other options due to location). Was happy to leave after two nights. Staff was mixed - some delightful and some uncaring. There is no comfortable place to have a drink and look at the view (which is gorgeous). Nothing remotely cozy. So if you want to stay in a place that has supposed ""cool factor"" this would work. But I don't think the feel represents the warmth and beauty that I have experienced in Sri Lanka.",Negative
"The views from the top are spectacular. We thought the food was good.The rooms are extremely dark and this is not helped by their being painted largely black. The space for suitcases is also painted black, with no light above, so packing has to be done almost by touch.My main complaint was that with everything so hard and dark edged, and with the bed up against the wall to the corridor and up against the doorframe - which was not soundproofed - it was hard to sleep for the noise of people walking up and down the endless concrete corridors and pushing their metal housekeeping trolleys around from before dawn. The AC was noisy and vented its cold air straight onto the bed so that you had a choice of a stiff neck or overheating. The shower floor is of the same smooth black tiles as the walls, with nothing to hold on to, so very slippery and dangerous..It is up to fifteen minutes walk from reception to the furthest rooms, so not at all convenient to pop back after breakfast.The idea that this is built to merge into the landscape is risible. It is as if the Barbican in London had been overtaken by jungle following radical climate change. Sitting outside is not attractive when one can see that the plate glass of your window is thick with insects that may be mosquitoes.If the purpose of a hotel is to provide its guests with a good night's sleep and send them on their way relaxed, then this hotel fails.",Negative
"I was one of a group that stayed here for three nights. None of us liked it much, and we were glad to move on.After hearing good things from friends and reading encouraging reviews online, this hotel turned out to be very disappointing.To begin with, it is a rather painful drive of almost 5 hours from Colombo with nothing of interest enroute. The much-vaunted Geoffrey Bawa architecture doesn't really work too well here. The place has a cold (almost industrial) feel and the corridors are way too long for comfort as well as being gloomy. But even worse is the poor upkeep: peeling paint, sloppy finishes, scuffed furniture, corroded & ill-fitted bathroom hardware.Because the hotel is located away from anything else, there is not a great deal to do apart from the cave temple at Dambulla and the Sigiriya rock (both involving rather strenuous climbs). The Six Senses spa in the hotel is not a good ambassador for that brand, both in terms of its facilities and ambience. The food in the restaurant is just about average.I would have given it less than 2 stars but for its warm staff and commanding views.",Negative
Stayed here for two nights in an deluxe room. The room is getting old and the bathroom was pretty run down. The initial look of the hotel is amazing and the views are fantastic. Food was just ok. Staff were mostly friendly. Had several billing issues so make sure you look over the bill when you leave.,Negative
"After a wonderful time in the Maldives for our honeymoon we headed to Sri Lanka, a beautiful country. Sadly this hotel added nothing to our trip, it needs a serious refurbishment and some good management. The layout and amenities are poor, there's just nowhere to go and relax and nothing that feels welcoming - which you need after a day exploring - even the bar is horrible. The food was good though and staff tried their best. Needs a big rethink if it's to keep charge what it is charging, wish i could get a refund.",Negative
"The room is tired and dated with more bugs and insects than you would expect even knowing we are in the middle of the jungle.The food quality in all the restaurants was awful - 3/10. We did the buffet on the first night, the food was tasteless, over cooked and of poor quality, especially considering the Western prices. When we complained to the chef after the buffet he admitted he was ashamed of their offering. He comped our meal and we signed for the drinks. When we checked out the meal was on the final bill - I asked to see our signature and they showed us an unsigned check.The second night we ate in the cafe, $15 for four shrimp all either raw or over cooked. The shrimp were wrapped in pastry so you couldn't tell what part of them you were eating including the head. Incidentally the appetiser came out five minutes after my main course, my partners meal came out 10 minutes after that. My club sandwich had clearly been made much earlier and then refrigerated - not acceptable for $18. My partners burger - the meat was indecipherable. When we complained about the timings (in addition my wine came out 10 minutes after my partner's cocktail on four occasions), the staff just laughed at us and gave us some excuse about different kitchens and bars preparing the food and drinks.You're trapped at this hotel for food choices and they exploit this to the full charging way too much for poor equality food.There is not enough furniture in the cafe or by the pool and we struggled to find a place at both. The cafe gets very busy in the evening because people realise the buffet is more of a rip off and poor quality than the bar - $15 for spring rolls?!?The music in the evenings took me back to the 80's to a cheap package holiday on the Costa del Sol in Spain it was loud and intrusive.The cashier was trying to do three things at once when he checked me out speaking to his colleagues both on the phone and sitting next to him, he even stated checking out another customer before I was done.On check out we complained to the duty manager. He seemed very unconcerned and just gave us a feedback form to complete. He said the problem would be fixed immediately - how ridiculous.This hotel needs some western influence in its management team if it wants to successfully cater to western tourists, because the quality and value for money are simply not acceptable.",Negative
"I had been looking forward to our stay for some time, several friends had given the hotel great reviews, but I am disappointed overall, you can not deny the location and Bawa design of the hotel is stunning but ......The interior is tired and in need of an update, the furniture and fittings are generally shabby, the once I imagine pristine white walls in need of white washing, in the hotels location there are a lot of insects, which leave their mark on the walls to maintain the standards the walls need constant care, which I would expect from a hotel such as this.Service is generally average, but the service during the buffet breakfast was particularly slack, I asked for tea in a pot and got more stewed tea, disappointing for a country that generally does tea so well. For dinner this we went al la carte, this was ok if overpriced.Hopefully the management has plans to renovate soon as this what this style icon needs to out it back where it should be.Based on this experience I would not stay again at this hotel",Negative
"The view from our room was fantastic and breathtaking.. It is situated embedded within the jungle hence its a unique experience.. Sadly thats the only positive thing i can say about this hotel besides some of the extremely helpful staff. The outdated fittings in bathrooms to furniture at this hotel is disappointing to see given its a 5 star resort in sri lanka. we stayed at the Dambulla wing during out stay. Perhaps their new wing has updated rooms.. They were not prepared to handle a larger group at all given we had bought half board. During any of our meals, the restaurant staff couldn't seat us in a timely fashion. The hotel was fully booked hence they had no structure in managing the restaurant correctly. we had to wait easily 10-15 minutes to see where we sit, while they were requesting to move other guests around ( which i think must have been inconvenience for them as they had full plates ). Regardless of speaking to the restaurant manager etc, who was very apologetic, didnt really help. It was an experience, i wish not to repeat and doubt i will visit here with any large groups.I must however commend the wait staff outside the restaurant, who were very attentive ( specially by the pool & the bar ) who did a fantastic job with our group..",Negative
"The hotel is beautifully designed and the views around it are breathtaking. Bell boys and cooks are warm and polite. Quality and cleanliness of the room was as expected. All of that positive memories were, unfortunately, overshadowed by Very Poor First and Last Impressions of the customer service provided by the hotel front desk and check-out staff. Reasons are as follows: - During our wait for check-in, my boyfriend and I were seated by a male staff who stood only next to my boyfriend and excluded me, the female guest, during the entire conversation (a good 3+ minutes). I was not busy with my phone or running around taking pictures either.I wonder if this action stems from cultural bias where males are more highly regarded than females.- During our check-out, we were presented with a bill that contains a couple phone call charges that do not belong to us. We had to insist strongly that the false charges were not ours before staff hesitantly removed them and no apologies were mentioned. Mind you, those false charges amounted to less than USD 1, and we spent USD 170+ to stay at this place. It is not the amount, it is the principle.In addition, we had to pay a fee for a local phone call that resulted due to the incorrect information that was provided to me by their front desk staff. We were not very happy.- Additional Con: Staff at the transportation department provided inconsistent price quote for our car ride to Sigiriya (a popular tourist location near the hotel). One staff said LKR 6000 while another said LKR 7000 one minute later. On another instance, we learned from the hotel that a car ride to Colombo was going to cost LKR 22000; then we searched online and found out that outside car service was able to take us there for LKR 13000. That's a difference of LKR 9000 (USD 63) in price!!! By the way, quality of cars were similar, if not the same. To say that we felt this hotel nickeled and dimed us is an understatement.For the same price this hotel charges per night, we had much a better experience at Taj Samudra - a 5-Star hotel in Colombo - where customer service was impeccable, guests are treated equally well (from beginning to end) regardless of gender, and the bill is not riddled with false charges.In conclusion, I will not be returning to stay at this hotel and I will not encourage others to do so.",Negative
"My girlfriend and I were looking forward to staying at the Heritance Kandalama, so I was rather disappointed to discover a dated hotel, which desperately needed a makeover. The rooms and décor were probably quite impressive in the 1990s but, 20 years on, it all looks a little tired. The service was just okay, certainly inferior to other hotels in the same price bracket. I get the impression that this hotel was once majestic, but sadly now just rests on its laurels. The panoramic view over the lake was undoubtedly spectacular, but does not make up for the more obvious failings.One final point, the hotel will automatically bill your credit card (without consent) in your home country's currency, rather than Sri Lankan Rupees. The exchange rate is not competitive and adds considerable cost. I am appalled that this is their routine practice and it only seems to be a problem with this particular hotel chain. Overall, this was a disappointing stay and I would not recommend this hotel to prospective guests.",Negative
"Came with great expectations going by some reviews but the whole experience thus far has been very 3 starish. The property has potential but efforts have not been put in to deliver a superlative experience. Some of the camps back home in India do a much better job. Poorly trained staff, bad housekeeping, grim & depressing interiors, average food spread, inadequate lighting in public areas (even in and around the pool). No personalisation whatsoever. Seems more like a hotel meant for groups and not families. No effort made to inform guests about facilities and amnestied available in the hotel. Wifi is painful. Panoramic room has no panoramic view.!! For the king of money we paid to come all the way here, we could have had a fabulous stay at a top of the line 5 star chain in India.",Negative
"I was having really high hopes and selected Kandalama Hotel to stay with my wife for the honeymoon. The Welcome was not at all as expected. At the reception there were abour four or five people and they did not know about our reservation until I showed them the booking I made via my laptop. Then we were asked to come to the lobby where we were offered a welcome drink and we had to stay there around 20 minutes until the booking was traced,Fine with that. Then comes the room selection. They said that the room has been upgraded and I had no clue whatsoever about what they meant. Finally they guided us to the room number 501 which was near the bar and right beneath the Kanchan restaurant.At the first glance the room seemed okay but not as the way it seemed in their advertising site. The bell boy was really decent and bought our bags really quickly.The room I requested was a Deluxe room with a king sized bed. The bed had a small deco with some ugly looking green coloured leaves which was very unpleasant though it was made in the shape of a heart. The bedroom floor was dusty and had scratches all over the floor. Just check the images. Not at all acceptable Fine with that too.The bathroom was having streaked mirrors and the tiled surfaces were looking like as if they were half cleaned. The garbage bin near the commode was having some red coloured stains all over the bin and it was broken. The pedal was broken and I couldn't open it even with my hands because it was really really dirty. It was half way open and did not close too.What I am describing is this Unused Deluxe room my friends OK ? Wait.. more to come.We had a shower and the water began to collect inside the Jacuzzi and I found out that the draining plug also was not working properly. I had to call the room service and they did some plumbing which took around 2 hours. Luckily we went out to see the outdoor environment.The Balcony was also really sticky and littered. There were dead animal carcasses all over the floor, I mean small crickets and other small animals. They could have just cleaned the room before we came in for gods sake !There was three reminders for us to be dressed in smart casual for the dinner which was really a nuisance. We were anyway dressed in full covered casual clothes.Then it was around10pm and there was a lot of noise coming from outside the room as people were chatting and singing just outside in the Bar I guess, There was the piano music as well. really troublesome for a new couple.But the room AC was nice, Dialog TV was good, Minibar was ok, bed linen and lighting was also ok.Be careful when you park the car in the park which is infested with monkeys at times !The Kanchan Restaurant was the only heavenly thing that we had there and the food was really good and the staff was really nice.Overall experience was really not good because of the above mentioned problems we had.I had a really big faith towards Kandalama and this is how it ended right on my honeymoon.They could have done a real better job than this for the amount they charge for.I think the room just near tho lobby (near the bar) is not at all recommended.I am really disappointed to offer this stay especially for my newly wedded wife.A word of caution to all the honeymooners and couples, just check the room before you go in. I mean check everything . Hope you got something out of my experience.I stayed there on 2015 July 27th.All the best people!",Negative
"Similar experience to and agree with the review from holidaychiclondon.In summary, if you are...- a family- who want to visit Sigiriya- who enjoy eating at a crowded buffet with okay food 3 meals a day- who place a very high value on the architecture of the hotel (to the detriment of almost every other amenity)...then this is the hotel for you. In every other scenario, you will be disappointed and overpaying. To put it crudely, it's like a HoJo's, but set inside the Guggenheim.Take note that this is quite a remote location. The road from Colombo to Dambulla is an utter mess and takes 7-8 hours. Taking the train is not really an option either. Once you are there, there isn't anything nearby and just getting out of the hotel grounds requires a taxi ride at the ""hotel rate"", ie: you are a foreigner, you pay quadruple the price, thank you:)",Negative
"Aren't we lucky that we don't all like the same things in life??We stayed in 8 hotels or guest bungalows on our trip in Sri Lanka and this was the only one that we didn't like. In fact, I couldn't wait to leave!I had doubts about it before we left home, but reading some of the excellent reviews it has made me think it would be fine. I was wrong....it was just not for us.There is no doubt that this hotel is innovative and has great views. But I do wonder if there isn't a touch of the 'King's New Clothes' syndrome about the place because it was designed by the great Geoffrey Bawa. Personally I felt like I was in Superman's Fortress of Solitude. Surrounded by thick concrete walls, and it was all very angular, the whole place just felt so impersonal.We had a superior room with a good view over the lake, but the jacuzzi bath design was potentially lethal! We are both pretty fit and we found it hard to get out of the bath, fearing we'd fall and hurt ourselves! Also when showering, the water splashes out between the wall and bath. A problem in the making? The windows by the bath looking out over the lake are superb, but mist up when you turn on the shower so you can't really have a shower and view at the same time. Lovely lighting in the bathroom, but soap & shampoo dispensers that are not really practical. All in all the bathroom felt a victim of form over function!We stayed two nights and ate in the buffet restaurant both nights. An amazing array of food, but surprisingly and sadly the choice for vegetarians was very very poor. 1st night, the main veggie option was a very ordinary lasagne. The 2nd night was worse – an anaemic and watery spaghetti dish. Such a shame that there were no veggie options on the tandoori /barbecue offerings offered outside on the terrace.There is minimal interaction with members of staff - it all felt very impersonal. The treatments in the spa were quite pricey but despite that very little availability unless you are around in the middle of the day.I'm so sorry we didn't stay somewhere else. Our trips to Sigiriya and Dambulla were memorable and very special. But this hotel was just not for us.",Negative
"I agree with the other reviewers that weren't impressed with this hotel.The most disappointing thing for us was being referred to this hotel by friends for our honeymoon. We booked 5 nights and wished it was only a couple. We were upgraded to one of only a few suites.Sadly, I write this from our room this evening at 11pm where a disco has started up downstairs, channelling huge BASE BEATS through our room. A DJ is on a microphone. Calling reception a few times they cannot tell us when it will finish. We were not even warned of this circus. This is not the tranquil, peaceful rainforest hotel that was once designed by architect Geoffrey Bowa, it is now a money making machine- trying to squeeze guests of every last penny and run party's on weekends for extra return.We have been so shocked by the ignorance of this hotel, as the previous 2 nights we had an outdoor generator running , keeping us awake for most of the night.Considering the rates, it's definitely not up to scratch as a 5 star hotel and is really a 3.5.The hotel is 20 years old and architecturally impressive. The service is poor to satisfactory, with some staff forgetting to send the bill (despite asking several times) and often forgetting simple things like tea and coffee.This could be a great hotel, with a refresh of the common areas and dining concepts.Sadly, we are hugely disappointed after being recommended & going by the many positive reviews on trip advisor. Our review we hope will help others reconsider or better still the hotel to change its ways.",Negative
"The Design is great, but it's poorly maintained. Rooms were not clean especially the bathrooms, the rolling shade was full of dead bugs and have a very bad smell. The staff were not very friendly in front of house but the guys doing breakfast were great. The pool attendant was the most unhappy individual ever and barely acknowledged our presence and did not speak to us. Overall this hotel has massive potential but lacks management involvement everywhere except for the breakfast team, otherwise service was slow and the place just generally felt unorganized. Before arrival I had to call it to make a request and rather than deal with my timed request, I was told to call back in 3 hours when I'm closer to the hotel so someone would deal with my request then...of course I had to re explain the whole situation again. Had an allergy issue with Cashew nuts that resulted in my son getting extremely sick the first night and eventually the next day the chef did agree that one dish did have cashew nut paste ( this totally ruined our first night as he was up getting sick ) but there was never an apology from anyone, this is really poor, we drove 6 hours straight to get to the hotel for 2 days and nobody could be bothered to apologize for my sons allergic reaction, the knew because I spoke with the Chef directly the next morning - even though I spoke to the manager and a chef the night before who assured me all the dishes had no Cashew. On departure I was not asked how my stay was, only if I used the minibar... but I did ask for change and was told NO! however there was tour guides coming in all the time (at least 5 while I was checking out and they were freely making small change for them) clearly not interested in the customer.",Negative
"This is an absolutely stunning hotel, with incredible views, beautiful rooms, very attentive staff - simply 5 star!We stayed here during our honeymoon in Sri Lanka for a night and were surprised that a hotel as good as this was the only hotel on our whole trip that didn't do anything for our honeymoon. All other hotels decorated their rooms, special tables in the restaurants, etc., but this hotel missed that detail on our booking completely.When we were asked whether everything was to our liking in the morning, we told the staff member that we were slightly dissappointed, but apart from a quick apology not much attention was given to our remarks.The best thing was all the wildlife that you can see here. Bats fly through the hallways at night and monkeys fly past your bedroom windows in the morning!",Negative
"I agree with the other reviewers that weren't impressed with this hotel. Considering the rates, it's definitely not up to scratch as a 5 star hotel and is really a 3.5 to 4 star offering. The hotel is 20 years old and architecturally impressive. The service is poor to satisfactory, with many staff seeming uninterested or completely forgetting your request (I.e. getting tea at breakfast).Our room was quite good and the morning visits from the monkeys quite fun. The gym was a bit dated but served it purpose.This could be a great hotel, with a refresh of the common areas and dining concepts, a repurposing of the upstairs lounge and some re-education in the staff department.",Negative
"It's a beautiful hotel, with stunning views over the lake. I loved the architecture and loved our room. We did get moved from level 5 to level 3 on arrival, we weren't told why, but it didn't matter too much. The staff - as they are throughout Sri Lanka - are lovely.But, there are a few big BUTS.First the tours desk has a lot to answer for. We asked for their assistance with organising tours of the cultural triangle. There were able to provide us with a suggested itinerary and a driver for our stay. The price seemed ridiculous compared to our other trips we'd organised in Sri Lanka. When we queried the price, there response was to offer us a 10% discount. Hmm.So I went on Google typed Dambulla taxi and called the local company. They were able to offer the same service, for half the price. A saving of about $70 USD a day. And by the way they were brilliant. So my question to management is, as a 5 star hotel, should you treat your guests this way? Is picking up the phone to make a booking worth a premium of $70? It's a little shameful I think.Secondly the food in the a la carte restaurant is very poor. I suggest if the exec chef hasn't dined there for awhile he probably should. For example adding crotons to a bowl of lettuce doesn't constitute a Caesar salad. The buffet on the other hand is very good.",Negative
"There is no doubt this is a stunning building and location and it was a highly memorable experience staying in this hotel. However for the very high price there was a lot where the hotel fell down flat on its face and I have very mixed feelings about my stay.To start with, the hotel's own booking page was not working, inexplicably inflating the price at the final purchase stage, and we booked through a third-party website. Then when we arrived it took nearly an hour to confirm our booking even though we had all the reference codes etc and then when we left we were over-billed and had to have our departure delayed by nearly an hour to get the balance refund. We were also charged twice by the hotel for the single booking.We stayed in a superior ""panoramic"" room and while it offered impressive views and a balcony, it was a lot smaller than expected, on a lowish floor, and worst of all was dirty and rundown. It had not been cleaned properly on the day, there were smears all over the bathroom, and it also looked like it had not been cleaned properly in a very long time (see pictures of the toilet and furniture, which was in a very poor state for a five star hotel).There was not even a small bottle of water provided in the room, unlike at other hotels in Sri Lanka that cost a fraction of the price.We ate at the hotel buffet in the night which was very average and massively overpriced at $30 per person. I would recommend getting a taxi to another hotel or restaurant in Dambulla. The breakfast buffet was OK but nothing special.Basically the hotel as a building is stunning - and people have written about this extensively already - but it is very badly run. It was memorable in a good way - I have never seen anything quite like it with the bats and monkeys in the hotel, the elephants outside and the incredible views - but it seems to be drifting into a state of neglect, filled with package holiday tourists and buoyed only by original architecture, location and reputation.",Negative
"We have been to Heritance Kandalama last weekend to spend our vacation. We received a very warm & nice welcome as we expected. The hotel has the greatest view in Kandalama and its mind blowing. Hotel staff were very friendly, pleasant looking and always helpful. Room service is so fast and we do not need to wait for our necessities even for 15 minutes. We stayed at a deluxe room with the Jacuzzi, which is not in a good condition. Bed is not comfortable at all and pillows too. Air Condition is not working properly and it’s so warm in the night and so annoying. All furniture looks very old, unclean and have dark spots everywhere. Bed room couch also having dirty cushion covers. There is no good to tell about the bath room as well. It’s so dirty and lot of dark, muddy patches everywhere. Especially wash basin, commode, and Jacuzzi has very dark muddy patches & so horrible to see even. Bath room tiles have not been washed properly for a long time. Over all bath room is awful. We had a good swim at Kanchan pool which is quite satisfactory. Food is not too good. And very few variation as well. When we ask for bicycles from the reception, to have a ride around the lake they said that they do not have any available since all are under repairs. We did not except this from Heritance Kandalama, as few years back it has a unique history with great rooms and fabulous food.",Negative
"Out of all the hotels we are staying at on our grand tour, this was only one of two that we specifically selected. After reading other reviews we expected a long check-in. We were seated and given a welcome drink. We were then given another table, but no drink. Our guide eventually went and chased the staff up. The hotel has two wings, both 500m long. Typically we were in the end of one. After the trek we arrived at our room to find the spare bed dumped in the middle of the room taking all the floor space. We asked the staff to sort it our, and walked back to the bar. When we got there we were told no alcohol as it was Poya day. As I stormed off, the staff then thought to mention we could have in the room. However on our way back to the room we noticed that our luggage still had not been delivered, so we took it ourselves.The hotel is famed for its stunning views over the lake, we were one of three rooms out of the 152 to have stunning views of the rear service yard. As we enjoyed the beer on the balcony, the monkeys came to visit. We repelled the first attack, but on the second, one of the blighters got into the room and pinched the sugar.We decided to treat ourselves to the Ah La Carte menu which meant we had the go to the Kaludiya Room. The room has no atmosphere what so ever, and we got the feeling that staff prefer couples, rather than a family unit. However food was delicious.We returned to our room to find the a/c was either on full blast or off, and combined with the rock hard beds, I would say our overnight flight into Colombo was more comfortable.Although there is a WI-Fi connection it's so slow that it's a waste of time.We have a complex breakfast rating based on choice and taste, this hotel scores 100%Only the good food gave this review a poor rather than terrible. Let's hope our stay next week at the Heritance Tea Factory Hotel, Nuwara Eliya is better.",Negative
"Although it old, this is still a great hotel. The design and siting is fantastic, and although the staff are very slow we found them helpful.The big problem for me is the 'luxury room' which I booked online was described as having a view of the rock fortress. This was complete rubbish. We were on the bottom level (level 2), the room was also in a corner so the view of the garden was obscured by the adjacent building. And the room also had a generator beneath which was VERY noisy. The manager kindly turned it off each day but only at my request. The room internally was lovely.I think it would be a great place to go have lunch and a swim in the horizon pool, then stay somewhere else where your top dollar (and it is very expensive once you include taxes etc) will get you much better value. It's also worth noting that the hotel is about 45mins from Lion rock.So avoid level 2 and especially room 204. If you can get a room on level 5 then the view would be fantastic. Try and confirm this prior to booking.",Negative
Once you're in you're in. There's nowhere else to go for food. And they definitely take advantage of that. I didn't come to sri Lanka to eat poor imitations of western food I could get at home for the same price. I feel the assumption is that if we're here we're rich and that's not the case. Not enjoyable.,Negative
"We're currently staying here - one more night to go - and I'll be glad when it's over. The room is lovely and comfortable with nice views but the food is terrible, alcohol overpriced, and there's nowhere else to go. Don't stay more than a night.",Negative
"Recently we visited the Kandalama Hotel with a group. Most of them were not really satisfied with the staff. Personally I left two of my own expensive cigars with the Barman in the Humidor because I was going to dinner. After coming from dinner I found there was only one left. One was sold to a guest of the hotel. The answer given to me : it was an accident. I couldn't believe because the two cigars were not in their stock. I went to the Senior Management, but they had not really good answers.",Negative
Although this hotel has wonderful reviews on tripadvisor it was not for me. Although the room was large it was dark and lots of insects. I went back just as the cleaners were leaving to find a dead cockroach in the bathroom. We asked for a snack by the pool to be told we had to move to the terrace to eat but later on another client was served with a plate of chips. This hotel is tired and although you expect insects in an area like this you do not expect to be bitten to death whilst having dinner in the air conditioned restaurant.,Negative
"The hotel looks much better in the photos online than in reality. Though the view from the common areas are very nice, you only get a lake view room for the highest class of rooms. The rest - superior and deluxe rooms - have to make do with views of the jungle - trees and monkeys. But that is not the worst part as you wont stay in the room much, as according to the hotel website, there are so many activities provided! Ya right.After reading the descriptions on the website, we decided to a bit of cycling in the morning around the Kandalama Lake and informed the reception the previous night that we would need all the 4 cycles that the hotel had next morning at 7am. The booking was promptly confirmed and we woke up very early and made our way to the reception. That was when a series of rude surprises changed our perception of the place. Firstly, we were informed that someone else had taken the cycles at 6 am and had not yet returned. We waited for half an hour and then decided to come back after breakfast. At 9 am, we came back and were first told that we could not do the cycling around the lake as track was too muddy. So we could just bike on the dirt track that leads to the main highway. Fascinating information that was withheld to us last night. Then when we reluctantly agree to go ahead, comes the next shocker. One of the cycle's seat was so high only a 6-feet 4 inch guy could have gone on it. The other bikes come with adjustable seats but this one does not. When we asked them, the reception manager came up angrily to us and blasted us for wondering why the seat is not adjustable. If it is not, it is not. The manufacturer wanted it that way, and if we don't want it, then he can't help it. So in reality, they just have 3 cycles and not 4 because any normal Asian guy could not have got on to that bike. If they had told us this at the outset, we would have planned something different for the morning. Instead, we had wasted the whole morning and the manager was not in the least apologetic about it. And mind you, this is not a free activity. We would be paying for it. In the end, we decided to just call it a day, packed our bags and left the property as fast as we could. No point paying for rudeness.",Negative
"For the massive prices I'd expect a lot more. Some dignitaries were checking in so they had 5 staff to their four we were ignored, the manager yelled at the staff consistently whilst ignoring other guests, the wi fi only works in the centre of the building. Despite advising them that I was vegan there was no effort to make sure I had something to eat so dhal for the thirteenth day running it was. For the huge prices you'd expect five star service but you get better at three star venues who are trying to impress. I get the distinct impression they know they have an amazing building and people will come so the service can go jump. I won't be back, will try somewhere else in Dambulla instead.",Negative
"Bawa, the famous Sri Lankan architect, did a nice job of blending this hotel into the surrounding countryside, and the staff is friendly, but the hotel is badly in need of renovation, and the interior is cold and without charm. The small pool is surrounded mostly be untended grass and earth instead of a large and pleasant deck. The bar is a hole in the wall with no inviting place to sit, and the bartenders had to be told how to make some basic drinks. In our room, the toilet handle was almost falling off and the porcelain was stained, and there weren't sufficient electrical sockets for today's device-laden guests. The wooden trellis outside the rooms was crumbling. This is ostensibly one of the best Sri Lanka has to offer, but like much of the country it is overpriced for what it offers.",Negative
"We have always wanted to go to this hotel and was extremely disappointed that it did not live up to expectations. Room was not ready, son was sick and we had to wait ages for them to provide a bed. Used up all the towels and it took 3 hours to get more the next morning. We were upgraded from a deluxe sigirya to a suite in the Dambulla wing (after being badgered straight away to book a £250 cave meal). Unfortunately we did not get to go to the meal because we were all very sick (first time ever in Sri Lanka) and the refund they promised is still not on our credit card. Fortunately we had a very efficient Kuoni rep to help us get things sorted. The views from the original Sigiriya Deluxe room were superior to the 'upgraded' Dambulla Suite which did not have a balcony. The standard of food for a 5 star hotel was poor and over priced. Service was a nightmare and trying to get anything done took forever. Orders constantly wrong e.g. chicken given instead of beef, chips instead of rice and no flexibility with the kids meals. The infinity pool was great and the pool attendant the best. The rooms we had were 502 deluxe which was quite noisy being near the bar but with fab views. Suite 627 Dambulla wing was tired and needs some attention. All rooms have fab views. Will not return and the other two hotels we stayed in Colombo and Negombo respectively had far better food at a good price with excellent friendly / helpful customer service. This hotel has a monopoly in the area so probably does not need to try anymore and can charge twice as much for inferior food and drink.",Negative
"Could not help feeling disappointed arriving here from the Jetwing Beach at Negombo although the peaceful location surrounded by wildlife was a very different experience.On arrival we were given a welcome fruit juice in the bar overlooking the amazing infinity pool but the loud Xmas pan pipe music on a very short loop that was always playing in this area is enough to send anyone crazy.The small room we were taken to was not the superior room we had paid for and had a view straight into bushes. The bell boy rectified this straight away and we were then taken to a large room overlooking the lake but we could not understand why this had happened when the hotel was not near full occupancy. We were more than happy with the standard of this room and large bathroom, a little strange that the wardrobe was in the bathroom but a minor point.One aspect of our stay we did not like was due to the open plan corridors and the location once you stepped outside your room you were enveloped in a cloud of tiny insects and these were also splattered heavily all over the walls.It took us a while to get used to the unusual design and layout although we did not mind. The hotel is 1km long and is cut into the rock so although we were on the 7th floor we had to go down to 5th and back up to have a look at the swimming pool at the other end of the 7th.I think our visit was marred really by the disappointing restaurant. I know some reviews have praised the food but in my experience although there was a great selection it was just barely kept warm and the cold curry available at breakfast was the exact same curry from the night before. On top of this the drinks prices here were far more than any of the other four hotels we stayed in and looking round the restaurant we noticed very few people ordered anything other than water, presumably because of this. Also the restaurant seemed a bit reminiscent of Joe's Canteen.The best aspect of our stay was the grey and brown monkeys that appeared on the balcony, by the outside breakfast area and around the infinity pool, especially the odd one carrying offspring. I would give 5 stars to the excellent and friendly staff, especially the pool attendant who would go to the trouble of spotting monkeys, iguanas in the trees for you.The carvings in the corridors and large white Santa in his sleigh were a nice touch. There were some traditional musicians in the bar some evenings.With a better dining experience I would have rated much higher.",Negative
"450 meters from reception to rooms is a long hike , to a tiny room with agreat view of the Kandalama lake.Step out side to the balcony and guess what?..... no seats only a bolted down table......20 minutes and still waiting for room service! Guess its a long way to bring a drink from the bar.Value for money this place is certainly not it, suggest travellers look else where - this place is huge ,empty and no heart.We stayed in room 528 for two nights around 6 meters by 4 , crowded with useless sofa and oversize desk.Unimpressed !!!",Negative
"This hotel is quite expensive compared to other luxury hotels in Sri Lanka. And yet, we didn't enjoy it.It is very big, and caters to a lot of groups of tourists. It felt very impersonal.We were lucky to be upgraded to the 2nd best room in the hotel, and the views were very impressive indeed. But the room, while very big, wasn't very well thought out, wasn't very practical, and the furniture looked tired. The AC was either on or off, and when it was on, the room was freezing.The food was served on a buffet, for breakfast and for dinner. Food was mediocre at best.And finally, what we did not enjoy at all was the insane number of mosquitoes and flies. I understand the hotel is in the middle of jungle, so you would expect some of these. But they were so many that we had to rush inside the room and immediately close the door behind us, and even then they were still quite a few which could make it inside. In the morning, all the dead flies were litterally covering all the floors, it was crazy. We had never seen something like this.To summarize, we thought this hotel was very overpriced, and while you may want to experience this unusual architecture in the middle of the jungle, you should expect that to come with A LOT of bugs.",Negative
"We recently stayed three nights at the Heritance Kandalama. I had booked through their website, largely on the basis of the rather amazing looking pics there and the reviews on tripadvisor. I didn't really shop around, and I now think that the rate we paid (around $375 a night) was way too high for what was on offer.The plus points: the building itself does have architectural interest (designed by Geoffrey Bawa, Sri Lanka's leading architect), there was a real sense of immersion in the jungle (monkeys on our room's balcony) and the site was pretty convenient for the sights of the Cultural Triangle (or as convenient as anywhere is in a country where travelling 50km takes 3 hours). The staff were friendly and the treatments we had at the Six Senses spa were excellent and well priced. Our room (a Deluxe in the Sigiriya wing) was comfortable and well designed.The negatives: the place could do with a refurb and some of it could use a good deep clean (e.g. the windows in our room were streaked with dirt). Dinner in the main restaurant was a buffet: lots of food warmers filled with lukewarm, just-okay food. The breakfast was better but the a la carte meal we had in their nearly empty signature restaurant was pretty average also (although in some ways the dodgy titles for some of the dishes were worth the price of admission: ""Memories of Bismarck"" for a herring salad, anyone?). Internet connection was poor and, as others here have mentioned, you need a new password from Reception daily. Service levels weren't really five star standard.All in all, the place was fine. But at the price they charged us, they are playing in a price bracket where fine isn't really good enough - pay $50 more a night than we did, and you can stay at Amangalla in Galle, which is simply in a different league. We are currently staying in the Jetwing Beach in Negombo, also owned by a domestic Sri Lankan operator, and it is cheaper and a much better property overall. Ceylon Tea Trails were about the same price and provided a great experience.So: don't do what we did and pay full price (a fool and his money are easily parted etc etc). If you could get a room for $150-200 a night (and there are probably good deals around, as a lot of our fellow guests were part of organised coach tours), it would be a reasonable choice. At more than that, I don't think it offers good value.",Negative
"I cannot agree with the overwhelming praise for this hotel.  We stayed one night in a panoramic room, for 290 USD for B&B.The hotel is undeniably architecturally stunning.  It's beautifully integrated into its stunning setting and the wildlife completely surrounds you.  We enjoyed watching the beautiful eagles preying on fish and other animals above the also very pretty infinity pool.  On arrival, we were greeted with a drink and wet towel, all very fine and dandy.But: RoomWe were shown to room 524, which overall was average.  The room was relatively spacious, but not overly so.  The furniture is decidedly tired and shabby - see photos.  The cleaning was also decidedly average (though better than average for Sri Lanka).  For example, the lampshade was stained, the cushions were grubby, the pillows were lumpy.  There was grout missing or mouldy in the bathroom, the chrome was coming off the taps.  The marble bathroom tops were covered in lime scale.  The windows were filthy on the outside in the bathroom and only a bit better in the bedroom. In the hotel's defence I didn't complain about the quality of the room immediately, which I should have done.  Then at 10:30 at night, when I found the mouse droppings, behind the desk whilst hunting for a spare socket, I did complain, but couldn't be bothered to do anything about it - get housekeeping in when you're about to go to bed? I said we would discuss it at billing time.FoodThe hotel is not within easy reach of anywhere, so you are hostage to their food and drink pricing.  We paid approx 100 USD for a totally average to poor meal in a freezing cold a la carte dining room, two spirit drinks and two beers.  If I had paid that much in a major European city I would have felt ripped-off. Breakfast, in contrast, was decent. Or rather plentiful and entertaining.Eco credentialsThe building design is in itself very sensitive to the environment and the climate.  However, the air conditioning is set so low in all the enclosed areas that they are burning through power at the rate of knots.  When we arrived, our room thermostat was set to 12 degrees C, fan on highest setting.  We turned it off and it took all afternoon and night for the room to get comfortable - with a blanket on the bed!  Same for the dining areas, in which I needed long trousers and long sleeves.BuildingIt's a very long building.  Personally, I thought the building was fantastic, stark and subtle. My husband said it felt like an underground car park, and when people walk down the hallway it echoes through the building (which may explain why the hotel encourages you to go bare foot?).  Going back to your room for a cardigan for dinner is a 7 min walk.At check-out, my discussion on the state of cleanliness of the room led to a 10 percent discount....on only the items in addition to our room.  So 10 dollars off a 400 dollar bill!So, as a luxury top-of-the-range hotel, it is grossly over-sold. If I paid 70 euros for this in a major European city, I would think it an acceptable price.  But a month's wages in sri Lanka should get you a whole lot more than this.",Negative
"Can´t understand the good reviews.We traveled a lot and have never seen such a rip off! We are still on the trip in Sri Lanka, a beautiful country with great hotels. But this hotel is a shame.Some parts of the hotel look nice on their webpage but the main part ugly unless you book the most expensive rooms. Most have bad view or none and their facade is old and apparently a part of the hotel is in renovation. Our room was opposite to the workers quarter. This was no problem till 5 o´clock in the morning when they started work and talk. From ten in the evening till 5 in the morning we woke up 5 times as the doors are so heavy and the people close them and the echo on the floor is loudly amplified, not mentioning the people talking loud. Changing our room was promised but the day after not possible anymore. It wants to be modern but there is nothing about it, there is no special feeling coming up, nothing compared to what much cheaper and better hotels in Sri Lanka have to offer.So far so good, one sandwich and a few chips for 13 $ and a local beer for 6$ in a faceless hotel in Sri Lanka? It is a shame to eat snack and beer for 2 people for 38$ (not a meal, just a sandwich!) in such a hotel when you know the average earning per month is below 130$ a month!We were booking our hotel for 368 $ for 2 nights and payed with Visacard in Euros as they did not print the price on the machine in Sri Lankan rupees, they just converted the Euro to their bad exchange rate of the hotel to the dollar and then again to their bad exchange rate of the hotel, again in rupee from the dollar (368$ at an actual exchange rate of 1,24$= 1 € and adding the extra taxes of 25%= 370 Euros) They charged us 398 Euros. So where are we?New York, Tokio, Paris, no it´s Sri Lanka and no holiday feeling at all in this hotel, besides the huge price for such a hotel.The only positive aspect is that it was clean.The breakfast was average. Huge breakfast room, very crowded with locals and a few foreigners.The hotel is from one side to the other close to 1 kilometer. If you have bad luck,you have to walk from one side of the hotel to the other side for your breakfast and back. Have fun! We were in the middle of August and there were mainly Sri Lankans, people from UK andjust a few people from other countries.We were sitting in the evening on the terrace on normal light, no candles, nothing romantic, no illumination of the hotel facade, no warm colours, just a modern and basic look inside and on the terrace. The pool has no lights on, no warm atmosphere at all.We recommend not to stay there if you want to keep your good mood. In Habarana are great hotels and you are closer to all important historical sites which are worth to be visited.Apparently the tour operators avoid this hotel. We haven´t seen any groups. Maybe that is why. We recommend not to stay there if you want to keep your good mood. Apparently the tour operators avoid this hotel. We haven´t seen any groups. Maybe that is why.We are wondering about the positive reviews!Our conclusion all together!Low quality, average, loveless, very expensive for so poor facilities , loud and a rip off.Stay away if you want to relax and enjoy your holidays !!!!!!!!!!!",Negative
"For tranquility & nature lovers hotel in right spot. My experience however with children aged 18,16 & 12 the hotel is at least 20 min drive from any sort of civilisation. We stayed in Sygria wing & unfortunately found the room in need of upgrading & cleaning. Cupboard door hanging off furniture generally scratched & worn, also shower & bathroom not clean. Perhaps due to time of visit & location numerous flies/bugs which did not aid to cleanliness.The hotel is not as per brochure,5 star.",Negative
"We stayed here for 3 nights. We were given a hideously dark & depressing room initially - located on the 2nd floor & apparently a superior room - by a swimming pool so there was lots of noise when we arrived. After some complaints, we were eventually upgraded to a 5th floor (panoramic) room which was better BUT it was still tired and in need of a refurb. There was an over bath shower but no shower screen or curtain so the whole place got soaked when we took a shower, windows seemed to be selloptaped together in parts, soft furnishings were watermarked & smelly, lots of noise outside the room with coming & going of coach tours all times of the night etc. Dinner is buffet-style and there was a feeling of a bun fight every evening getting to the buffet. Difficult to know whether this was an exceptionally busy weekemd as it is a public holiday weekend here but it was rather off when we were asked to vacate our table when we were finishing our very pricey drinks (a beer & a glass of wine cost c$15).",Negative
"January 02nd 2012:This was the 5th time I have stayed at this hotel on my numerous visits to Sri Lanka. I can safely say it was my last. The hotel environment is beautiful but the rooms are outdated, bathrooms need an overhaul, beds are hard and uncomfortable, pillows are terrible. Service; well its average to say the least. Found it hard to find someone who understood English let alone speak it. The buffet which has been outstanding in the past, was barely passable and it was confined to another room, crowded and not enough staff to handle the busy Christmas holiday period. If not for the a la carte restaurant we would have starved; as the high price of the buffet of $35 was not worth it, ala carte was better food for the same price. On checking out of this hotel; a girl stood at our bus saying we had not paid; even though I showed her a receipt, on my husbands investigation someone had signed something to our room; no signature or name. Very strange and unusual practises here. Wont be coming back...",Negative
"We ended up staying here for one night; we were originally going to stay 2 but decided to only stay for 1 as we were not that impressed by the hotel. First they messed up our booking so we had to end up paying more money than originally expected, this place is not cheap by the way, they then did upgrade our room which was nice but they only did this for 1 night so if we wanted to stay for 2 like originally planned we would have had to move rooms. The hotel itself is quite stunning but not as amazing as I had expected, the pool is pretty cool though.Apart from the rooms being very expensive the food is also ridiculously over priced as is the taxi service they offer. When we asked if they could organise a tuk tuk instead they turned their nose up at us and told up they do not deal with those types, we did end up finding one though. You also have to wear trousers in the restaurant so I was made to change my smart looking shorts for shabby jeans, we also found out most of the other guests are oldies as the restaurant looked like an old persons convention. Maybe explains there backward view on the shorts.So all in all the hotel is lovely and nice but probably more suited to old or middle aged travellers who like waiters to wipe the side of there mouths and call them sir and madam.",Negative
"After traveling 6 hours from Columbo to reach this hotel, we were ready to climb some hills, experience some nature, and have some good food. Unfortunately, while the hotel is located in the midst of some interesting landscape, there is little to no effort put forward to allow guests to experience it. Two of the 3 advertised guided walks within the jungle were not offered due to wet conditions, so we embarked on the 1.5 hour ""jungle trek"", which consists of a guide leading you through the shrubs near the hotel to the top of the hill and back in about 1:15 with little to interesting learning about the animals, plants, geology, etc. Similarly, the boat ride on the lake could have been fascinating, for it seems to be teeming with life, but the hotel sent us out with ""guides"" who are really just there to paddle. There's horse riding on offer, but this consists of a nice fellow leading you for about half a kilometer on the road leading to the hotel (not terribly scenic) and turning back-- more of a photo opportunity than an experience. We were terrifically bored at this hotel and kept wondering what other people DO here. The pool is cold and by late afternoon there are too many mosquitoes to even enjoy sitting next to the pool. One evening there was a local magician who visited, this was about the highlight of our stay. We were obliged to pay US$250 per person for the gala Christmas dinner and couldn't believe that not even one soft drink was included in the price of this. Which leads me to the food. A 5 star hotel which entertains so many foreigners and children really should offer some child-friendly meals you'd think. Not the case here. Far from being child-friendly, our whole family caught some food poisoning at this place and 2 weeks later are still in great pain. I suspect it was the cheese served at the hotel. We are cheese lovers but after our first taste of the cheese on offer at this place, felt we better stay away. So, boredom followed by painful illness.",Negative
"The rooms smell! The rooms could be cleaner, ths staff more helpful and it is staggeringly expensive for what it is",Negative
"We stayed here for two of our four nights in Sri Lanka as part of our visit to the Cultural Triangle. They provided free accommodation for our guide/driver.We had been expecting a quality and tranquil experience, as many TA reviews had been positive, and certainly the price was high by Sri Lankan standards.We arrived on a Sunday afternoon to be greeted by loud music being played in the communal area near the main swimming pool. The receptionist commented “we have families that come out from Colombo for the day to use the facilities and ‘enjoy’ the entertainment”. Together with the noise of kids around the pool, it certainly drowned out the sounds of wildlife that we had been looking forward to.Our room was a long walk away, which perhaps was a blessing in disguise. It had a balcony, which we shared with monkeys in the morning. In the main, the room was fine, although rather dark. However, we did not expect a large Jacuzzi in the bathroom of this so-called “Eco friendly” hotel – a contradiction in terms!We went to the bar for a drink. This was in the midst of the Cricket World Cup, and the walls had been tackily ‘decorated’ with large paper flags of the participating countries, with cricket pads on either side of the bar. The loud TV cricket commentary dominated the scene here. The cocktails we ordered were badly mixed.Then on to dinner. The buffet restaurant was packed with large European tour groups on both evenings. We estimated that private guests amounted to less than 10% of the diners. The food was of the blandest “to suit western palates” cuisine. Service, though, was attentive.On checking out, we were competing for porters with 3-4 coach loads of package deal guests, so we carried our own cases about 300 metres to the reception, having been hassled by a persistent “need to check the mini bar” person as we were getting ready.All in all, we really did not enjoy our stay here. The location was nice enough, we would have enjoyed the environment and abounding wildlife – but sadly the atmosphere was not convivial. We also met a couple at our next hotel, whose opinions were similar to ours about their stay here. Of our 120+ hotel reviews in TA, this was one of the worst.",Negative
"so we stayed here because as far as i know it's the only decent hotel around, if i had to do it again i would keep moving to another city to stay somewhere else. it was old, out-dated, dirty and gross. but dambulla is nice, they have nice things to do and this hotel may be your cup of tea so go for it. we didn't like it because we found it dirty and out-dated and the food was the worst we had in sri lanka. also, there were bugs everywhere and i stress everywhere!!! we don't do bugs and outdoorsy stuff so if you're like us, again pass. there was a great mountain thing to hike nearby which we didn't do but we did stop to take pics near by with it in the background lol. also, the hotel had bats everywhere as it was a sort of open air hotel. monkeys everywhere which they were cool but you're not supposed to interact with them. the area around it and the mountain its on are beautiful though, very green and lush as sri lanka in general is. anyway, good luck on your choice",Negative
"Having been told so much about this Hotel we were very disappointed, the staff were not interested in us. The food was all buffet and always cold unless you went and had it prepared in front of you on the BBQ. Had to send back main course twice to get it hot. Service left a lot to be desired. The place was cold and (not their fault they had rain) and the rooms damp. The A/C only worked on cold no matter how high you put it. You could not open the balcony door because of the monkeys and I agree with a previous writer the location leave you in the middle of nowhere. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone and have requested the travel agent removes it from their list.",Negative
"We stayed for 2 nights in a luxury room in Heritance Kandalama. The architecture of the place is unusual but not particularly suitable for those with young kids. There are monkeys all over the place - one chased us till we ran for shelter to the main hotel. There are no kiddy amenities or open spaces for children to run around. The food was just about okay, but pretty over-priced. What really put us off the hotel was the pathetic response to our complaint that there was no hot water in the bathroom. We complained over 4 times from 6 in the evening till 10 pm. Each complaint would get attended to by one engineer, who would come, turn all the taps on, look foxed and disappear. Then there would be silence till we complained again. Over the evening we were visited by 5 engineers, but the water stayed cold. While checking out I complained to the manger and got a weak apology in return. As our van began exiting the premises, someone ran up and thrust a bottle of jam through the window, as compensation – that feeble gesture was even more annoying – surely when a hotel of this stature should ensure good service, and have a better approach towards dealing with guest complaints.",Negative
"This is a hotel which cannot decide its own direction and certainly does not justify the 4 or 5 stars it claims.Basically I surmise that this hotel survives on tours and unless you are on one avoid it at all costs.We travelled as ""independents"" in a deluxe room and paid the full price. The location is fabulous and Geoffrey Bawa's design magnificent but it is gettiing tired. Rooms and surrounds are showing signs of shoddy maintenance (gaffer tape on windows etc); the top pool and the small (childrens?) pool either empty or not working and the landscape grubby.The food is the real let down; basically execrable buffet rubbish. After painfully enduring the tour groups feeding frenzy on our first night in the main resaurant we subsequently ate in the ""a la carte"" Kalu Diya restaurant which basically served the same quality food on different plates at exhorbitant prices; also undoubtedly the worst club sandwich I have ever eaten.On the positive front the staff were always friendly, attentive and very helpful. The best aspect was being there during the day when the hordes were out and deciding to cut our stay there! Monkeys also great fun.Fortunately we then went to the Aditya which was everything the Kandalama was not yet is inexplicably lower rated!!",Negative
"We stayed in the Heritance Kandalama for 2 nights in March 2010 on a private tour across Sri Lanka. Upon arriving at this property, one is impressed by the beautiful and lush surroundings. At first glance, the room looks nice and the bathtub which sits almost like a balcony as it jets out with a view of the surroundings is an excellent concept. However, after a while, one can tell the hotel is in dire need of renovation. It is old and worn. The worse part of the hotel is in the evening. There are lizards everywhere. Every night, after eating dinner and returning to our room, we would find at least 3 lizards in our room. I was so terrified, I had to sleep with the lights on. Some of the lizards were huge. We also found other small bugs and ants on our bed. I understand, I am in the wild but I do not necessarily need to sleep with all the bugs and insects. If I enjoyed that, I would be camping and not paying $150 per night for a so called 5 star hotel. There are also monkeys hanging about outside your room and you are suggested not to leave the balcony door open as they will come into your room. At least, that part I can manage as we did not open the balcony door.We had half board which included a buffet breakfast and buffet dinner. We found the items in the buffet line to be cold and lukewarm at best. Only items you cook to order was hot and edible. The first night, there was a grill outside with shrimp, chicken, pork, beef. The items there were good. The second night, they had vegetable tempura and chicken stir fry. Also, those items were good since they were hot in temperature. Breakfast was the same. If you order eggs or omelets to order, they were good. The buffet items were not very good.It would be hard for me to recommend this hotel to a friend since I do not care to stay at a place with worn down rooms full of bugs and insects.",Negative
"It could be a nice place, but everything is going down the drain. First, after 2 hours in our room, the A/C is not doing is job, to cool down, So we had to pack and move down to an other room. The A/C is working a bit more. But not to the level of a Grand Hotel. I must say that the personnel is very up to the challenge. They smile and wish to help. The cleanliness is Sri Lankan level, should i say more!!!.The food, well a buffet is a buffet, When we ask , à la carte, that night there was no à la carte menu, so another so so buffet. If you still want to go, use a driver, the road up to the Hotel is a challenge .the view for a sunset is very nice over the mountains.",Negative
"Well, we were looking forward to this hotel as we'd heard so much about it. Designed by a famous architect with ""green"" in mind.Good points: The view. The staffBad points:The general decor - really could do with a lick of paint lots of scuffs everywhere, plenty of wasted space, minimal decor and soft furnishing resulting in a resounding echo everywhere indoors. Overall, a bit like an empty school in the summer holidays.The rooms - Need a good clean plus, re-decorating and stains removing from cushions etc. Towels too small and used to the point of transparency.The excursions - done on the cheap i.e. no seat belts in transport - believe me, you NEED them! The lake safari - see the photo for mode of transport ...I am not joking! Our guides/oarsboys did not understand a word any language other than Sri Lankan. So could not describe anything. I thought safaris were supposed to be educational.The food: Buffet is reasonable but not exceptional. Good cooking but poor quality meat.Bar Meals: expensive carbs with zero imagination.The ""Fusion"" restaurant - good service but really poor food... fused in fact.Management - During my gentle complaint to the manager he took 3 mobile phone calls without so much as an apology and I was offered nothing by way of compensation until I it came to pay the bill. When I mentioned my conversation with the manager all I was eventually offered was 15% off a ""Fusion"" meal.The place is geared towards transient tourists who probably stop no more than 2 days passing through. In that context, (I mean as a B&B), I suppose you can put up with it. Whilst we were there, the hotel won an award for the best 5 star hotel in Sri Lanka by their tourist board. Hmmm. Personally I've stayed in better Travelodges. Its not even in the same league as the Fortress near Galle.",Negative
"We (me, my husband, and the kids) stayed @ the royal suit from 23 June for four nights. We stayed here in 2006 and the experience was phenomenal and this prompted us to book Kandalama for the second time. Our recent experience was way below the anticipated quality and not moneys worth at all. Quality of the food was pathetic and we had to tell the hotel staff to clean our dining table few times. If you expect a lunch buffet you are pretty much out of luck. The Spa is so low quality and almost non functional. If you can spend 500 dollars per night per room please go else ware.",Negative
"After a near death defying experience getting to the Kandalama hotel from Columbo airport, we were very dissapointed to find money had been stolen out of our hand luggage within 12 hours of arrival. The only people to enter our room were the cleaners. The hotel manager Priyan Wijerathne was all but useless in explaining the theft and returning our money. His answer was - I'm afraid there is nothing I can do, you'll have to claim on your insurance when you return to the UK. Other guests claimed that they too were missing items of clothing that had misteriously dissapeared since they arrived.To be honest, the hotel was OK. The rooms were in need of decoration but clean. The hotel staff were friendly but we were always wondering which one stole our money. I certainly wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone, the surrounding area was beautiful and interesting but because of our experience it tarnished our experience and opinion of the country.",Negative
"We stayed for two nights at the end of December 2007 as the start of our tour of Sri Lanka. We'd been looking forward to it as the website looks good etc. owever...While the location is stunning and the brutally modern architecture is interesting, the hotel seems to care more about style than substance. The public areas were poorly thought-out. Our room (right at one end of the 1km long hotel) was small and dirty and not cleaned-up much after our complaint.The main restaurant was more like Butlins than a 4* hotel with buffet food that was average at best.The only thing that stops me giving the hotel a worse review is the location and views over the lake which are superb. What a shame !",Negative
"We asked for a room on a high floor , quiet room and a bath? 1st room was scruffy, no bath and next to the kids? swimming pool, eventually we ended up in a suite on the second floor , it was quiet, no views, pity, and had a whirlpool bath. It was clean and the bed comfortable. Food is great if you like curry which my husband does and enjoyed very much. I had been ill on my journey and staff were kind enough to let me have a cheese omellette. Staff are really good at their jobs. We went on the hotels elephant ride which as it progressed we hated with a passion as the elephant was bullied into going where it didnt want to . The man in charge of the elephant hit it with a wooded stick and the poor beast quviered. This animal was being exploited the other end of the stick had a medieval metal spike which he jabbed under the elephants chin so that it would pose for pictures.",Negative
"This is a noisy, bustling people factory - we're glad we only had two nights. We stayed here just before Christmas and were subjected to the most appalling muzac pumped through the hotel's sound system to all public parts. Two Christmas carols (one in the daytime, one during the evening) played on the panpipes, continuously assaulted our ears. We and other guests complained - to no avail - although in the fine dining restaurant they did turn it down so that it was almost inaudible (but not quite). Apparently no-one knew how to turn it off. One of the waiters said he'd had to put up with the same music for the past week. This, the totally soulless bar and public areas and the really ghastly cavernous hotel restaurant where the noise of huge numbers of people eating from an equally huge buffet - put paid to any enjoyment of this eco-friendly hotel. Staff fed the monkies from the breakfast buffet (despite notices in our rooms etc. not to feed them) and then chased them away when they came back for more - very animal sensitive. There was not one intimate corner where we could sit quietly and enjoy the sounds of the jungle and really appreciate the beauty of the landscape we were in. The only time we found any tranquility was when we went for a swim in the hotel pool in the evening when the sun had gone down, or got out of the hotel down towards the lake. Our room was lovely and the view from the balcony spectacular, but that was the highlight. Kandalama may be a great design in terms of 'disappearing into the natural surroundings' but the moment you step through the entrance there is no chance of feeling at one with nature - its more like a visit to London Zoo!",Negative
"Reading some of the previous posts about the building work and I was told by my tour company after pestering them,that it had finished ---- not so.Up until 8 pm on the evening of the 15th Feb my wife and I were treated to the sound of pouring concrete over the roof of our room 515 or similar - Sigyria wing. Being in the Construction industry I thought I might help them get the job over before dark but I had already decided to have a shower in the sexy spa baths which these rooms are blessed with. There are no curtains its just you the jungle and the monkeys.So standing there in what is termed ""the all together"" and having a good scratch I was less than pleased to see one of the workmen waving at me from the roof above. People say I am friendly but I can assure readers of this post I am not that ---- friendly.I went to sink my teeth in to duty Manager but as usual he had gone home and someone else had to take the flak.In the end I refused to pay my drinks bill.To conclude - there is serious building work going on at this hotel so you need to take a very robust stance on the room you are offered. Your Tour Company will give you a load of rubbish about the work being completed all I can say is ----However this Hotel is in a unique location and is an experience which should be enjoyed, clearly not all the posts have had our experience",Negative
We were very exicited about staying here and refurbishment to our wing was supposed to have been complete - oh so wrong!We spent the week in the middle of a building site. There was construction noise from 08.00am to 20.00 pm every day (apart from when the Thai primer minister arrived for a stay). It drove us up the wall. It's was very very noisy.So what was good and what was bad.....Good stuff: The setting is beautiful. The food was excellent. You'll get a nice welcome basket and evening welcome cocktail with talk. Birdwatching (also lizards and monkeys) opportunities were brilliant. Staff were very attentive (sometimes overly so). The bathroom jacuzzi tub for two was just wonderful (overlooking the jungle too). If you like bats you will love the way they fly round the open areas at night.Bad stuff: There was no hanging rail in the wadrobe. We asked for this to be rectified on three occasions but it never was. I spent a week living out my case. Very annoying. TV reception is very poor so I wouldn't bother trying to watch it. The location is very isolated. It's about three and half hours from the airport and once you get there if you want to go out you have to hire one of the hotels cars. It's easy to arrange trips but it will cost you. You can't just take a walk to a local shop or restaurant. You will need to stay on at least half board basis. Also make sure you budget for drinks as these are VERY expensive. There are never enough coffee sachets left in the room. These are left in three sachets which is stupid when there are two of you in the room!! We'd often ask for more and always they came with three. We noticed they kept having a leak in the ceiling above the bar. It was dried up and covered over a few times within the space of one week. There were signs our room hadn't quite been finished before they put us in the room. There were some loose wires at the light fittings which seemed unfinished.What the hotel said: we asked them why they had opened when it was obvious they were not ready (bearing in mind we'd paid a LOT to stay there). They said they'd come under pressure from the owners (Aitken Spence I believe) to open up because there were people who wanted to come. We pointed out they were risking ruining their reputation and it seemed the staff were aware of this. They tried to apease us by offering some free stuff but to be honest all we wanted was to enjoy the setting in peace and quiet (the one thing they couldn't give us!).We were dissapointed because we can see that eventually this hotel will be truly lovely but just not yet. THEY SHOULD NOT BE OPEN RIGHT NOW. Had I known I would have waited one year before going. The hotel reckon that the Sigirya wing will not be complete before May and then there is the Dambulla wing to start on. Don't say I haven't warned you!!PS. The mossies are rife here so if you are prone to being bitten make sure you've got PLENTY of medication because there is no shop in the hotel to top up your supplies should you run out.,Negative
"I am slightly baffled how this hotel gets such good reviews. I found it to be tired, dated and in need of a complete face lift.It was rather sterile, almost like a large car park. Hard metal seats everywhere, very stark, no lovely foliage or tropical flowers or comfortable soft furnishings. There was a confusion with our room upon arrival and I am not sure whether we got the correct room or not. We never could get wifi in our room (for three days), the room looked tired, the taps on sink and shower were corroded, the shower door seals unclean, windows scratched and dirty and towels stained (though expect they were clean).The breakfast buffet was good. The hotel has just two restaurants, one buffet and one a la carte. The a la carte restaurant was dark and lacked any atmosphere. The hotel is quite a way from anywhere else so jumping in a tuk tuk to go to another restaurant is not really an option.I was really looking forward to staying here but was very disappointed.",Negative
"Heritance Kandalama is a good hotel, not a great hotel. We prefer small, boutique types and this is a large hotel with many rooms. The staff are polite and attentive but the large, buffet type restaurant got crowded and too noisy for our liking. There was plenty of food, prepared and displayed well but felt sometimes like a staff canteen. We were upgraded to a luxury room from a superior and we were grateful for the addition of a bath and a view of the lake. This hotel is a great base for being able to visit and climb Sigiriya Rock and going on a jeep safari, there is also plenty of wildlife to keep you amused especially the monkeys which visit your balcony! Heritance Kandalama is classed as a 5 star hotel, I would say a 4 star at best, it is showing signs of age and just feels too big and overwhelming.",Negative
"The hotel is located inside the jungle. Beautiful place, view, and all..But.We got 2 interconnected tiny rooms that were so dated that we cloud not stay in the room for more than 10 minutes.Must say that the office manager took the responsibility and make sure we got bigger rooms with better view.The hotel is in the jungle so you cannot go out to eat outside.The chef is very very nice and tried to help us with special meals as the existing variety didn't work for us.So my recommendation to you is:If you OK with non modern non luxury rooms and you don't mind to stay at the hotel at the evening, go for it. You will enjoy. We didn't.",Negative
"Stayed here for two nights during a week long tour of Sri Lanka. Overall it was a good stay and one or two of my gripes below are perhaps not an issue for most..PROS: - Large resort well placed for Sigiriya and other nearby attractions- The a La Carte meal/restaurant was wonderful- Excellent , well priced Spa. CONS:- Beware of the monkeys freely roaming around, including the corridors! - Quite a lot of wildlife in general (including I have heard snakes). Understandable to some extent given its location however you should be fully aware of this! - Looks a tad dated now in many regards. - the TV/channels were poor compared to what was available in most other hotels we used",Negative
"There is much about this hotel to like-the architecture, the gardens, the pool, the comfort of the rooms. But it was let down in little ways - you can’t read in bed because the light isn’t bright enough and the bedside lights can’t be moved, service in the cafe/ bar area was friendly but unbelievably slow ( a coffee took 25 minutes to arrive!), and at night the woodwind music from this area was still reaching our bedroom ( 2 floors down)at 10.30pm. The buffet breakfast had a good variety of food ( we really liked the vegetable omelets ) but the first morning no one took the trouble to explain to us how the system worked. And no decaf coffee anywhere in the hotel, which was a bit of a surprise in a place of this size/but maybe decaf isn’t a Sri Lankan thing?? Still -if you like monkeys, great views and the sense of being in a stunning place it has a lot to offer!",Negative
We stayed here 2 nights for our babymoon and honeymoon. Wow the architecture is incredible and blends well with surrounding nature. We had a lovely stay in our superior room. Even though the hotel was not full we weren't upgraded even for our big occasion. However we did have lovely celebration chocolates in our room. Large spacious room with the most incredible jacuzzi bath with a view. Luxury toiletries. You certainly feel at one with nature here and all the monkeys. Things we didn't like or need improving. - lot's of noise around the pool from other guests ruining the peace and tranquility. - the cleaners were very noisy in a morning with their trolleys and maintenance work going on throughout the day. - dress code happy to comply however my husband got sent back to the room for having a vest on. Yet women in there already with strappy vest and boobs out. When asked I got told its only a rule for the men?? - lastly extortionate cost for evening buffet 60usd for 2 adults 100% not worth it mediocre meal. We didn't realise if so would have ate at the pool bar.Lovely hotel but I do think overpriced and unfortunately overrated.,Negative
This was our second visit to the hotel. Our first visit was many years ago (2013) unfortunately I felt the hotel hadn’t been maintained well. This might be due to the lack of income during the COVID season . The luxurious feeling that was once there had slowly disappeared. But one thing that I still enjoyed very much is calm relaxed feeling I got due to unique architecture and location. I thoroughly enjoyed the walks in the hotel. The linen looked old and the buffet spread was mediocre( even though it was the Christmas season),Negative
"There’s a big difference between the internet description and actual experience about the ‘Royal suite’ if this hotel. First of all, according to their website description, the room has the capacity for 2, or maximum 3 people. But in reality, it has two large bed rooms, enough for 4 or 6 people, with 2 separate bathrooms. I booked this room hoping to get some extra space for my office work, but completely surprised by getting a suite for 6 people. The entrance to the room is so dark and spooky that one might take some extra measure to protect their jugulars. It’s quite different from the website picture of well lit room. There’s a stark difference between the website’s bedroom photo and the actual one. The view shown the the site (lake view) is nowhere to be seen in any bedrooms.",Negative
"High prices and facilities are given, but the actual rooms and facilities are not as great as should be in a luxury hotel. there as no room service at all, and customer service is not great. They just help you out at the start but that is it.We usually don't look for much facilities, but some friendly smiles would be nice!Will not be choosing this hotel again for a stay..",Negative
"Heritance Kandalama for me used to be the best hotel in Sri Lanka, hands down. Having patronized the place merely 3-4 times prior, it was one of the first places we included in our honeymoon list. Hence why we paid an exorbitant amount of money to book the hotel on the 1st of Jan to kick off the new year in style. Having experienced one of the best customer service ever in Water Garden Sigiriya, I should admit that our expectations were really high. Albeit our arrival and the rolling cameras were met by a lukewarm ‘Ayubowan,’ quickly followed up by a ‘Sir, you can’t park the car here, you’ll have to take it to the car park.” Whilst I do understand that valet parking was not an option due to the pandemic conditions, maybe it is best to ponder how an eager guest could feel in that moment.The superior room with jacuzzi we had booked was a small but nice room, however failed to amaze us unlike our previous visits. We weren’t sure if it was due to the high expectations we had or because of the fact that this was our 5th visit here (this was the first time we booked a superior room though). The toiletries had not been replenished, however was promptly rectified with a single call. I had requested special touches as it was our honeymoon, but sadly the hotel had missed out on it. We quickly felt the food standards have also come down quite drastically. Almost all the food were under seasoned and we had to look for the bottle of salt almost in every meal we had there.Whilst I understand and appreciate the COVID guidelines and precautions adopted by the hotel, I feel that they have taken it a touch far than required. Food was served by the chefs of the hotel, and oftentimes you had to look at their faces pleading for more (which inadvertently painted a picture of Oliver Twist). Even the waiters seem to be on a rushed schedule, maybe short-staffed and trying to cater to a large occupancy simultaneously. However, the hotel was kind enough to provide us a candlelit cave dinner at a reasonable price. It was one of the most romantic dinners we had ever taken part in. To be isolated around flaming torches and to be treated to a 4 course dinner filled with harmonica music was indeed what made our stay here a memorable one. Dhanushka who served our dinner was more than helpful and thoughtful to send a pack of chocolates to our room to help us cherish the dinner a little while longer.It was a bummer that the hotel did not have liquor during our stay. We were told that it was due to some licensing issue. Nevertheless, the calmness and the serenity of the hotel always kept us bound in a tranquil daze. The lush green around the hotel and the glistening reflection of the Kandalama lake reminded us of the architectural masterpiece linked to oneness with nature. As I mentioned at the start, following my previous few visits, there was no doubt in my mind that Kandalama was the best hotel in the country. However following this most recent visit, I have been taken aback by the sub par service and the drop in quality of the stay. I sincerely hope that this is only a minor setback and the hotel will quickly address these concerns.",Negative
The variety of the food was fully subjected to the number of guests. Surprisingly housekeeping was not available. It wasnt pleasant for clients with long stays. We had to clean the rooms by our self. Hope they would find a work around with the current situation.. The feel of the hotel was superb. Sadly pools were closed,Negative
View is excellent swiming pool is nice but one at 7th floor rock surface is slippery. Foods varieties are minimal no seafood at all (minimum).Plates are not cleaned properly just washed with dishwasher i think.Building are old not maintained properly,Negative
"Lovely to look at, lovely reception at arrival, lovely clean rooms day 1. We've booked a 3 night stay. What they didn't tell us is there's no room cleaning during your stay. There's no drinking water replenishment nor coffee station refill. You have to make the 2 Nescafe sachets stretch or call reception every hour from morning to get some in the evening. 🖐🖐. The best part, it's a shower/jacuzzi combo which holds the day's debris till your next shower and no house keeping nor do they provide cleaning products to help yourself (😂😂). I came to relax and rest but now I have to clean the tub with face soap and my sock so we don't slip when climbing in? I could have stayed home and had a bath in my own and cleaned it for the next day. And the icing on top, no fresh towels unless you find the one soul who sympathises. I understand Covid measures but cleaning a bathroom would in no way infringe on the health of your guests but would infect promote health and safety. I mean, we already sit together in a large hall for brekky. The 3 ⭐⭐⭐ are for the outdoors and the views. I recommend a 1 night stay (max 2 if you must) just so you actually enjoy your stay. Things might change, one Hopes.",Negative
"I'm sure this hotel was once great. Now it's dated and looks its age.Spa, toilet and safe didn't work in our room. Buffett meals were ok but not the great quality of Buffett at other hotels we stayed at. I would not recommend. Maybe I have high expectations?",Negative
"Nice property , and high standard architecture specially it's crafted with the rock.But have to say maintenance is substandard.Rooms needs to be upgraded .and maintain with high cleanliness.Buffet is ok...",Negative
"A lovely place on the side of the lake, architecturally stunning. Food is mixed, some lovely local cuisine but the sheer range of the buffet means there are some disasters as well. One point off for the terrible upkeep of the rooms, which are too dark to start with. As an aside there are no comfortable places to sit in the rooms. And another point off for the sheer indifference of the staff, particularly reception, which needs better training. The spa was an absolute highlight if you could find it.",Negative
"The hotel was built in the 90s and since then, not much of renovation has happened-obviously. The room was clean and ok. The sheets were probably washed 1000 times already. The bathroom was clean, a lot of calcification though - around the toilet and in the shower. The shower curtains had disgusting stains.The staff was very friendly. The buffets at breakfast and dinner very good - crowded with big families and their children though. Unfortunately one of the restaurants, the Kanchana, was closed. The Kaludiya restaurant disappointed. The cafe / bar area has no charm, didn't appeal to us at all.The spa is great and is not very expensive.The hotel is by a jungle-like area and has a view to the Kandalama lake, which is beautiful. The monkeys appeared on our balcony, looking for food, which was kind of cute. The area is offering a few trips - elephant park, Dambulla temple and a bit of cool street food in Dambulla. We stayed for 4 days and that was sufficient.Prices are too high for the quality of the hotel, in my opinion.",Negative
"The hotel is famed for its architecture & setting, which is beautiful and very well done, built around the rocks with no trees being destroyed. It is a lovely concept and very well done but the hotel rooms are quite tired and dated.It is also worth noting, which we hadn't appreciated it's a huge hotel spanning 1km from wing to wing. This means at busy times it has the feel of a holiday camp with huge volumes of people trying to dine at the same time in the huge buffet restaurant. To be fair for the volumes of people the dining room copes really well and the quality of food is good, its just not the most enjoyable ambience.Another point worth mentioning is that it's a long drive down an bumpy road to reach the resort, after many hours in the car touring it might be something you want to consider.One final point, is our check in experience it took in the region of 30 minutes to check in and despite taking our passports at the start of the process we had to fill in our own passport number on the check in form which seemed strange. Our driver later told us that the lady who was checking us in was on a double shift, so was probably exhausted but nevertheless it didn't make for a great experience after a long day.",Negative
"Famed thought its architect was and fabulous though the views are, the Kandamala needs a jolly good update. Rooms are spacious and clean enough, but leaking aircon ducts, old bathroom fixtures, tired flooring and old government-building olive green lifts show the hotel’s age. Good deals have attracted a lot of local guests.The fine-dining restaurant was empty and tediously offered the same dishes as room service! The buffet was popular, food plentiful but not outstanding. This hotel has been trapped in time with dated food offerings and a lobby lounge that features musicians singing tunes from the 60s-80s. So many staff members only smiled and interacted when directly spoken to; apart from that, they looked bored and some, downright miserable. Gym looked good and well looked after; nice pool areas. This might be one of the best for Dambulla area, but it’s not impressive.",Negative
"Heritance Kandalama has beautiful, distinct architecture though we found to the overall experience to be the least enjoyable hotel in Sri Lanka. The first room they showed us had a loud generator outside - and they kindly moved our room to a quieter side. But the food was overpriced (most expensive dinner we had in Sri Lanka) and not exceptional. And when we asked the hotel to hire us a private driver (which all other hotels accommodated us very easily) they first insisted we go on their tours of Sigiriya and Poḷonnaruwa before finally offering us their price list for drivers.",Negative
Me and my family stayed 3 nights at Kandalama and honestly this place was not a WOW !!! I have stayed so many others 5 star resort in Srilanka and unfortunately kandalama is far below average of those other places. Rooms are too old and cleanness is not up to the 5 star rating. I have noticed staffs have done so many short cuts during their cleaning service and I don’t think there are manager or supervisor checking on what are the service staff are doing day to day service.Food is very poor and choices are very limited. All day dining restaurant / fine dining restaurant / room service serving the same Ala carte menu and if you are on BB there are will be very little chance of getting what you want. Even the service at the restaurant are not so good and frankly they don’t deliver 5 star services.Some of the staffs that we met and gave us the service absolutely genuine. From F&B Dimut/ sandamali/ Sarath/ pastry chef / the guy who work at the healthy juice counter at the breakfast buffet they are wonderful. Also the Wasantha at the front office is a great person and he have done so much for us to make our stay comfortable.,Negative
"I rented two luxury rooms for my family, and we had a child with us. The problem started when we were warmly greeted by the manager, and he was so happy to tell us that they reserved two adjacent rooms for us, the best of the hotel. The rooms were just after the hall were you acces the pool, If I remember correctly it was 4A and 4B or 4A and 5A. Ok all great, swiming pool , excellent restaurant, great luck with table outside, perfect diner. We went back to the rooms, and around 1 o'clock in the morning, the horror started. The rooms are just under the restaurant, and the staff started sliding chairs and tables for half an hour, Baby crying, adults crying, it was horrible. A few hours later, just at half past five in the morning, THE SAME BALLET, screetching tables for half an hour. Spoke to everybody, nothing to be done. I tried finding the petit manager, who chose the rooms for me smiling to the baby, I couldn't, he vanished. Even though, I invited several people to the restaurant, and the dinners were perfect",Negative
"Without Bawa's original genius & the unique setting, this would otherwise be just another large, busy, chain hotel catering to busloads of 'rapid-turnover' tourists. Sadly, the Bawa spirit has long gone; that his ‘library’ is poorly marked & difficult to access is perhaps emblematic. With the exception of reception staff (generally unwelcoming), service is reasonably efficient but impersonal; there are three swimming pools & a reasonable gym. Whilst the infinity pool is indeed beautiful, the 'pathway' to & from comprises a collection of small boulders & mud. We had booked 1/2 board & only ate in the dining room; the choice & quality & quantity of food was more than adequate. Special thanks to the chefs cooking breakfasts & dinner options to order, often under pressure eg when large groups appeared and expected instant service! All credit to the chefs who remained calm & did a superb job!Kandalama should seriously consider adding lockable screens to balcony doors, both for mosquitoes and to reduce monkey 'nuisance’. We felt imprisoned in our room & unable to enjoy the balcony space - which was such an important aspect of Bawa’s ‘signature’: that of bringing the outside environment into interior living spaces. We could not leave our doors open unattended - even for a quick loo break - without monkeys entering the room; males sometimes became very aggressive when challenged. Another consideration would be the provision of umbrellas for guests to take off site. No other Sri Lankan hotel in which we stayed operated on Kandalama's principle; umbrellas cannot be taken off the premises (curious as there are no walking paths). We were offered the option of purchasing an umbrella(!) but declined as it would not fit in our checked luggage.",Negative
"This is one of the famous hotels in Sri Lanka designed by Geoffrey Bawa, one of the famous architects in Sri Lanka. The hotel is in a forest and provides a good view of the Kandalama lake. You find monkeys everywhere who will not hesitate to enter your room if the doors are kept opened (they had entered and taken some food when we visited last time as we had forgotten to keep the doors closed). If you are a nature lover, this hotel will probably attract you. Food had an adequate variety though we felt it was less than our previous visit about 2 years back, especially the dinner. The staff of the hotel was good. Rooms were comfortable and clean though no dental and shaving kits were available in the washroom. I had a bitter experience when I wanted to modify the reservation made for my family as I later realised that I should have ideally booked a double room with two children (aged 6 & 8) instead of a triple room. However, after taking two days, they refused this saying no odifications are allowed under the scheme. When I expressed my disappointment also, they were still mentioning my original reservation prevailed. It lacked courtesy too (we altogether reserved 4 rooms but one member couldn’t come. Even then, we didn’t make a request to change/modify it as we understood it would not be fair to make such request, given the conditions). This attitude and treatment of the management greatly disappointed me before the arrival. So, be perfect with your reservation, if you intend staying here and other Aitken Spence hotels. In terms of value for money, there are much better options. There are much better hotels/resorts by established and famous brands which will give you more value for money, flexibility and even go an extra mile to keep their customers happy. There is another resort managed by one of the famous and established brands close by, in Habarana (didn’t mention the name of the resort due to doubts on the disclosure) which has a great greenery environment with a better food variety (from salads to desserts with many action stations) and excellent customer service for a lesser price, giving excellent value for money.",Negative
"We stayed at Kandalama for three nights in September ‘19 during a two week trip. The setting was the most dramatic of our trip which included visits to Kandy, Kalkudah and Arunhadapura. The building has tremendous views over the lake and to Sigirya beyond. The hotel hugs Kandalama rock and the surrounding jungle means you are constantly surrounded by animals, birds, insects and reptiles throughout the day. The hotel has 150+ rooms and feels very big - while the rooms themselves are comfortable and clean, they are generic and nothing spectacular. There are a fair number of fixtures that are now becoming quite dated. The staff where very friendly and professional (as they are throughout Sri Lanka). As far as activities go, our ‘free excursion’ (through booking.com) was limited only to the morning birdwatching at 6am which was not clear during booking, and as September is not peak season for birdwatching we saw some, but not many. We also asked to hire some bicycles as this is advertised on their website, but we were told the hotel had no bikes. We were disappointed with the food on offer, only the buffet restaurant was available for breakfast and dinner. The Sri Lankan dishes where good but the buffet includes a huge range of dishes that were pretty bland, too salty and mostly cold. Good for variety but we felt lacking in quality.Kandalama is a good base for visiting Sigirya and Minneriya/Kaudulla national parks, both an hour or so away. Overall we recommend a stay at the hotel to appreciate the building and architecture of Geoffrey Bawa, but don’t expect the best food or accommodation available in Sri Lanka.",Negative
"As a super luxury five star hotel mangement should train the staff.We went bar for drink we wait sometimes to order just a beer.service was ok,back ground entertement was excellent,ambience was great and view was superb. Thank you being friendly with us our server but we choose to pay by credit card then they don’t have credit card near the bar so he grab my ATM card and went some where after 15 mintues he came with check so teach them about how to handle credit card no one can take away they are own creadit card. then our server asked ast sign the credit check then he gave me pen that’s a LB finance it’s so shame five star hotel doesn’t have hotel logo pen.anyway this is nice hotel but mangement should train the staff.",Negative
"I’m not one to write reviews but I felt in this instance sharing my experience may help other travellers. On arrival the staff seemed very distant and not at all welcoming. No greetings with smiles! We were lead along a stone face corridor to an out side cafe and told to sit, it felt like we were being lead to our cell, unfortunately insects galore. We waited nearly 40 minutes for our second room, considering we had booked in advance and arrived mid afternoon this seemed a little poor. The stay started off badly, especially after a 4 hour car ride.The hotel common areas don’t have air conditioning so using these areas is not the most comfortable during the day.The rooms are very dated, probably since the hotel was built in the 90’s. Everything worked but was very worn, the furniture, switches, the bathroom fittings and even the panelling on the walls all from the 1990’s. Only one of the sockets seemed to work when charging our mobile devices and having a shower turned out to be a hazard, up one step and then clamber into a high walled jacuzzi bathtub to have a rain shower, not great if you aren’t very stable on your feet. The blinds in the bathroom were mouldy and the shower doors leaked so the bathroom floor would get wet every time we showered. The TV picture was fuzzy and the hotels own channel seemed like it hadn’t been updated ever. The rooms were clean but the water little were not replace daily as advertised.We used the games room, again a semi outside area so no air con or fans, not very practical when it’s 30 degrees plus. Not all the advertised games are available and when we asked the staff they shrugged their shoulders.The service was fine with prompt response when requesting an iron and the laundry service.We stayed half board so used the first floor restaurant buffet for breakfast and dinner. The food choice was very good particularly the freshly made waffles at breakfast. Meal times were the best part of our stay as we could all sit as a family and converse in an air conditioned room. The only common area in the hotel that has air conditioning. The restaurant staff ran an efficient service.The view from our room was beautiful, looking over the forest and reservoir. The hotel sits camouflaged on the side of a hill and blends amazingly with its surrounding, you can’t fault the location.In summary - the staff especially on arrival could do with retraining and the whole hotel could do with a major upgrade, if you are expecting five star then I would choose another location because this place doesn’t have the substance to back the rating. We are seasoned travellers and know what to expect, especially for the price!",Negative
Just spent 3 days here and the hotel was beautiful rooms lovely bath with jacuzzi was nice although a little difficult to get in and out off but beautiful view when in tub .Would have given it a better score had the service in the restaurant and reception been better ladies greet you and take you too your seat polite but staff very slow to clear up and waited 15 mins for bill to be brought over to sign asked twice for water at breakfast this slow to arrive as was coffee .Then upon checking out was told to go to cashier office to pay bill before handing keys in so did this came out after paying handed keys in then approached by staff asking me to pay a bill explained that I had and the room in question was not mine ! Got bill out to show I had paid all done while sitting in reception this I found unprofessional so for theses reasons I say average,Negative
"- Customer service is below par, managers and staff barely speak English so any request takes longer than needed. - Room service and other requests take over 30 mins. - The pool did not feel clean, and general public were allowed to take photos of the infinity pool, so no privacy for hotel guests. - Rooms are dated and feel old. There are marks, stains and scratches everywhere",Negative
We had our honeymoon here 19 years ago so we were keen to visit it again with the family.The welcome is very warm and we enjoyed seeing the pool and the awesome views. The food and Beveridge manager Lalith Ratnayake made us feel right at home as the children swam and we ordered lunch. I was however a little disappointed as it is not as luxurious as I expected especially compared to other 5 star hotels today. It is 26 years old and is showing it a little. With some small changes this could be different. For example:- The pool loungers should be upgraded as the cushions were dirty and worn and the toilets by the pool table (used to change for the pool) were very dated. The home made pizza was tasty but the base did not look homemade but pre-bought. We loved coming back but not sure I would want to stay again unless I confirmed the rooms have been refurbished.,Negative
"The hotel is an architectural wonder - blending exquisitely with the surrounding forests and with stunning views of Sigiriya and Kandalama lake. The rooms are gorgeous and the food is wonderful. However, there were a number of things which concerned us. The railings on the balconies and the stairs are very low and seemed dangerous for small children. The ""Kaludiya"" pool's rock surface was very slippery. At the buffet, the pasta chef was totally unconcerned about the boiling water and hot oil which was perilously splashing out of the pans. My younger son got spattered by some of the hot water.The most horrifying event occurred when a small child was seriously injured when he walked into a glass door of the restaurant causing the glass to shatter into dangerous shards. We had expected a hotel of this calibre to have installed shatter proof glass. Overall, Heritance Kandalama is an absolutely stunning architectural marvel which will undoubtedly thrill the hearts of nature lovers. However, the level of safety, especially for young children needs to be improved.",Negative
"It is an architectural wonder and an amazing view. Food’s Great. but if you’re travelling with families it is not for you. Pools have no shallow ends, balcony's and other high areas have very minimal railings. Ideal for a romantic couple, but not kids.",Negative
"Great space and decorations. Nice view towards lake. Staff are neither warm nor efficient to Asian guests. Worst rooms are provided only for Chinese. When local people played loud music late in night and early in the morning, staff didn't attend to us for a long time after our calls. During breakfast, staff checked our room number many times. Locals and white people obviously received better service there. They should provide service without racism.",Negative
"I was really looking forward to our stay at this hotel. It is a stunning building in a beautiful location, with a lovely infinity pool. The food is good and the staff friendly. Unfortunately our room left something to be desired, particularly as we had booked before the troubles and paid more. It was part of a family suite (there was a connecting door to the next room) with two single beds pushed together. The bathroom fittings were corroded, there was a surprising amount of scale on the shower tiles and a CRT TV taking up a lot of room on the desk. Apparently the TV broke 4 days earlier and they didn't have any flat screen replacements. Quite disappointing for a 5 star hotel.",Negative
"One of the premier eco friendly hotels in Sri Lanka. This is another masterpiece by renowned architecture Geffory Bawa and the way hotel is designed blending with nature gives immense evidence of his caliber. Hotel is built with two wings connected to the reception area. It is pretty long from one end to another and it will take at least 15mins to walk this distance. Best thing about the hotel is the views over the Kandalama lake and the greenery you’ll see wherever you go.Food is awesome and had plenty of varieties to try on. Rooms are spacious with large bathrooms and balconies with views.It’s better to avoid weekends to avoid large crowds. On the weekend we visited there was a company outing and the hotel was so crowded and we did not have the expected calmness.Service was also average. They took about 45 mins to deliver our luggage to room after calling reception 2 times.Buffet area was so crowded and the service level goes down in proportion to that. At breakfast time there were no juice glasses and we had to wait long time to get one after asking for many times. And when we finally came to our table they had removed our cutlery and everything and had already started to prepare it for another couple.And after a while they removed our tea cups without even asking us whether we are willing to have a cup of tea or not. It’s just like asking us to get the hell out of here as soon as possible.I know it’s hard to manage a large crowd, but the staff must be professional enough to cater any crowd considering the big hype this place has got.Rooms also need refurbishment, specially the bathrooms. It’s not the 5 star quality you’ll experience here. Also when it’s crowded it’s get so noisy and you’ll hear people walking here and there and talking all the time. It’s not soundproof and you’ll hear everything. If you are to have a quiet night trust me this is not the place to be.In summary the stay is just average.",Negative
"A good place to spend 1 day, with climbing the Sigiriya rock in mind. Food is good but was much better a few years ago. Need an upgrade inside the rooms. All of this is can be compromised by their service which is at a high level.",Negative
"I liked the Heritance Kandalama. However, in all experiences we must consider the value for money question. Was it worth the money? Well in this case, I must say that small things like a bathtub with limestone stains or a window only cleaned on the inside, bugged me a bit. Also, the place is really peaceful during the week, but becomes messy on weekends with lots of people arriving in large groups at once. There are no shadows in the pool areas, other than the existing trees. The resort has a lot of activities like a game room and birdwatching tours, which are not divulged and only by chance did we happen to find them. We also found it hard to understand how the available restaurants worked. On the other hand, the staff is extremely kind and helpful, we were delighted with every contact we had with them. The rooms are beautiful and the scenery breathtaking. The food is excellent.",Negative
"Dear Kandalama Team, I was one of the few people who visited Kandalama amidst the chaos post bombings. It was not my first visit but I would certainly think twice before visiting Kandalama again. I booked a suite as it was peak at the point of purchasing ( cost was LKR 42K)  and I went along with my wife to celebrate my 1st Anniversary. Owing to my previous experience I guaranteed my wife that Kandalama will be such a delightful experience. Especially the dining experience because of the spread you have ; she is very adventurous in trying food & flavor. To our great disappointment it was ala carte for Lunch & Dinner with very little options ; breakfast was slightly better with an improved buffet .I do understand that these are difficult times as I represent the same industry as yours. But there are options to contain the damage with a far better approach than I witnessed ; because for me, that Kandalama experience was not worth 42K. The Anniversary cake which we requested was delivered when we were walking out of the restaurant after dining. I ordered 2 lime juices when I was dining because I felt at least the management should have to offer something in addition to an ordinary dining experience.Waiter brought a LKR 1000/- bill and the following day I requested the manger to write it off which he sensibly did. First place if someone had common sense that bill should never have been raised knowing very well what was being compromised. You being a 5 star hotel should learn from Aliya Resorts which is a 4 star hotel. They had the same problem as yours as the occupancy was very less. But they were sensible enough to offer buffer for both Dinner & Breakfast ; even during the la carte Lunch Rest. Manager offered whatever we order off the menu with no charge. That is the type of hospitality you expect in this trade specially during these difficult times by ensuring not to disappoint whoever turned up to stay. They even offered a discounted SPA experience to compensate for whatever missing. Kandalama had not even thought about it.I wish to convey my great disappointment of what I experienced and will think twice before visiting Kandalama again. Hope you can fix it, as yours has been a hotel experience I cherished all this time. I sent this entire complain to a person named cheranka which was provided to me by the Kandalama heritance official page. So far not an acknowledgement even! Hope you will have the courtesy to respond at least!",Negative
"My mum and I stayed here for two nights in March on our trip to srilanka. We have stayed at this hotel many times before. Upon arrival the staff were not overly friendly and check in seemed to be a little bit of a chore (not what you need after 6 hours travelling) we were shown to our room which was not up to standard. Mould around the toilet, no dressing gowns, no slippers etc. When we requested them the dressing gowns arrived damp. We asked for coffee around 4 times on the night of arrival from house keeping before it was finally delivered. The lady who had shown us to our room I think knew we didn’t have a great room and even mentioned about moving rooms the next day. We did enquire the next day but reception said they were full. For the price we paid we felt we had been a little bit robbed. The restaurant can feel a little like a cattle market if your not sat outside but none the less the food is very nice. The views from the hotel are absolutely breathtaking. The pool is very picturesque over looking the lake. To watch the sunrise and sunset here is really something special. We sore lots of wild life while at the kandalama which was also amazing to see. The hotel is a good hotel it’s just unfortunate it did not meet our expectations this time.",Negative
"We were really excited to visit this hotel having seen so many amazing photos online but sadly our overall impression was one of disappointment. The setting and views are amazing and the architectural design impressive but the hotel feels tired and in need of a refurb. We booked a family suite which was described as having views and two balconies but on arrival found that we were on the 2nd (lowest) floor and had no balconies and views of jungle only. We asked to move and to be fair the next morning were relocated to a suite on the 5th floor with balconies and great views. However the room itself was tired and in need of a facelift - the bathroom had broken fittings and limescale on the taps, and the jacuzzi bath - a real selling point on booking - didn’t seem to have been deep cleaned for a while so we didn’t use it. Other usual things that we have had in other hotels of the same standard such as a coffee machine were missing, with only instant provided. As other reviewers have mentioned despite there being lots of staff around, the service was very slow, particularly in the pool bar, and the staff were just not as friendly as we have met elsewhere. The buffet in the main restaurant was good for dinner and breakfast but the restaurant is very large and ambience was lacking. Overall I think maybe this hotel caters more for larger groups than individual travellers and lacks the personal touch of other 5 star hotels we have stayed at during our holiday.",Negative
"I visited this resort 15 years ago and loved it. I was so excited to return. But the change in the atmosphere and the general condition of the property has been disappointing. The staff are very average in their customer service. The whole place looks tired, especially my room. It doesn't look like any real upgrades have occurred since I was last here. Disappointing when this is the most expensive resort we have on our whole tour. It just feels sterile and resting on its former glory.Even the bedding feels old and limp. I really wanted to love this return stay, but I just don't.",Negative
"Best thing about this hotel is its location and the environment, we don't rate the hotel itself. The setting in amongst the bush was so peaceful and relaxing. In the evening a person playing a flute would sit high on the rocks above the pool and it was lovely to hear the echo of the flute across the resort area. PROS: • Spa was great. • Cafe cocktails and snacks nice and very reasonably priced.• Laundry reasonably priced• They have driver quarters for your tour guide to stay in. CONS: • Power points were dodgy and sparked when i tried to connect anything to them to charge devices. Connecting AC adapters were very loose and always fell out very frustrating and made me feel unsafe using them. • Rooms are very basic/ • Only provide shampoo and no other toiletries. Only 2 bottles of water per day then you must pay. • Service is hit and miss depending on who you get. • Breakfast is average. • Bed was lumpy through middle and pushes you to edge nearly fell out. • New Years Eve Gala dinner .. we knew nothing about it. No signs up no information when booking. When we were walking back to our room after our spa treatment a lady at reception asked us if we were going to the Gala dinner – this was the first we heard about any Gala dinner! Poor form Heritance. • Shower over bath and cant even have shower head clipped above head level as the water cuts out in the shower hose handle. • Rooms are very noisy. • Internet was slow at times. • Shower over bath with a clingy shower curtain.",Negative
"The hotel itself (building) is fantastic, set in the hillside with a fantastic outlook of lake Kandalama. The rest leaves a lot to be desired. The hotel staff are friendly enough but not what you would expect from a hotel of this calibre. We walked past the front reception and we counted 12 staff, not one said hello let alone smile. This is meant to be the face of the hotel. Breakfast is also underwhelming. Quite a few items empty and not replenished. Quite untidy even bordering on not clean. While sitting eating our breakfast they decided to unpack the dirty linen on the floor next to our table. Was almost difficult to get tea and coffee. For dinner you must wear long trousers, for me it implies that there are certain standards. I don’t think it applies here. Food not up to that sort of standard especially when this hotel charges like no other in the area. During our stay apparently staff had a party with family. We were not told about this and on break from touring to relax in this supposed 5 star all we heard was extremely loud music. We couldn’t even hear the tv.We had adjoining rooms which were nicely furnished but one of the fridges did not work. Also very dirty and moldy.The gym is in dire need of an upgrade. 2 out of three treadmills did not work and the equipment is very old.We were very disappointed with this hotel as we were very much looking forward to it. Compared to other like hotels in Asia it falls well short of the mark.",Negative
"The views are breathtaking and it’s the perfect spot for watching the sun go down. it also served as a good base for day trips. the hotel itself is ok, and nothing overly wrong with it, but it failed to live up to the expectations we had and, to echo other reviews, is more like a 3/4 star hotel. We paid for a room upgrade to ensure we got a balcony but wish we hadn’t bothered as all rooms have balcony and struggled to see what we got above and beyond. the towels were thin and not quality you would expect. there were no spare plug sockets in the room either and so we had to keep unplugging other things.staff were mostly accommodating however also quite abrupt and didn’t really feel like servers enjoyed their job. can’t knock the food at all - it was great. definitely varied by day, and selection was best on our first night (we stayed for 3) but still very good.biggest bug bear was lack of atmosphere and outside seating. in the evening, we really wanted somewhere to chill and enjoy a beer or cocktail and despite there being copious seating ‘areas’ inside they were all dead. simply putting a bar/place to get drink on top floor would have been sufficient and some music to encourage others. talking to other guests they felt the same. there was no ambience. as a result, only option was to go to room which was a shame and it felt much more like a conference hotel and seemed much more set up for this than for holiday makers (perhaps they prefer conference guests?).it’s no doubt a stunning hotel but it is looking tired around the edges and in need of some updating.we stayed at the Heritance Tea Factory as well and this was a completely different experience - very welcoming from the moment we arrived.",Negative
"This is the second time I stayed at the Kandalama with the other time being a wonderful stay some 6 years earlier - and the hotel appears to have had  little to no maintenance and overhaul since which is disappointing. Firstly I can’t fault the staff and they have genuine passion to make the guests feel welcome and the food is good through breakfast and if you choose to eat at either restaurant. The atmosphere at night as the guy plays his flute in the rocks surrounding the hotel as you’re sipping on a cold lion lager is wonderful, and it is very calming.The biggest gripe is that the suites, bathrooms and swimming pools really need to be upgraded before it becomes a real issue for such an establishment to manage. There are now other hotels in the region that have cropped up over the last few years that will leave the Kandalama behind and that would be a real shame, and investment is needed.Would I stay here again - likely not, but I would if it were to receive some TLC.",Negative
It was interesting to stay in this much hyped hotel and one we don't regret for 2 nights of our 3 week holiday in Sri Lanka. The apparent wonderful Geoffrey Bawa architecture was lost on me as I thought it was a concrete monstrosity lacking in ambience and comfortable communal areas to enjoy drink and conversation. Our room was reasonable but dark and certainly not of a 5* standard. I have never been on a large cruise ship but I imagine the self-service restaurant where we ate both nights (as we were on half board) is much like you'd find on a ship - vast with a huge amount of food to suit all tastes but I dread to think of the waste ... doesn't sit well with the hotel's eco ethos. Having said that the food was very good and we appreciated the unlimited supply of filtered water which isn't automatically offered so had to ask for it. Note that the drinks are overpriced and the hotel is popular with tour groups. I wouldn't return or recommend as there is plenty of choice in the area.,Negative
"I have visited this hotel several times in the recent past. The hotel has an incredible view, one of the reasons I love this place. Its design is very nice, it mix with the jungle and the lake. I never stayed though. We always went for the lunch (buffet). Some days the buffet was good, have many varieties, and food was also tasty. But some days, the quality and the number of varieties is far from acceptable. Specially considering the high price tag, it could be improved. Most of the staff provide a reasonable service. But not very friendly though. Hotel seems cleanly and well maintained, however the quality of food and the service could be bit improved.",Negative
"This is an ""eco-hotel"", and is built onto the side of a large rock. At first glance, it's unusual, and attractive. The rooms are fine - but beware monkeys on your balcony! We had an astonishingly good meal here in the á la carte restaurant - the equal of any European restaurants. The public spaces are actually rubbish - sparse and uncomfortable seating, echoey areas, and a generally unwelcoming atmosphere. Classed as a 5-star hotel, based on my experience elsewhere in the world, I'd call it a really good 3-star, verging on barely adequate 4-star.",Negative
"Stayed here for 2 nights during a tour of Sri Lanka in February 2019. Sighted on the edge of a lake with Sigiriya Rock on the other side of the lake and Dambulla about 10 minutes away by car. Built into the surrounding rocks. Nice room overlooking one of the pools and the jungle, at the end of one of the wings so a bit of a hike from the restaurants etc. but easy access with lifts and wide corridors so no problem. The restaurant offers a buffet service and the food was good with a wide choice to suit most tastes. However it is very large and very noisey - a bit canteen-like. Service was fine. Worth getting a half-board option as there is nowhere else nearby to eat. Where this hotel falls down is that it does not have comfortable seating areas to enjoy a relaxing drink or conversation in the evening. The bar area on the floor below the restaurant has a few very uncomfortable chairs that do not encourage you to spend time there. As one reviewer has said - all a bit utilitarian - no ambiance. If we were to go back to this area I would be looking for a different hotel purely for these reasons.",Negative
"Very overrated and terrible rooms! Don’t be fooled by the pictures as whilst you do get the most amazing views from your room and the infinity pool, the rooms are very dated, can get claustrophobic and noisy! The fan creeks when on, the AC has one full blast loud setting, you hear your neighbours and the worst of all was the floor cleaning machine used in the corridors at ALL times, whether it’s nidnight or early hours, with no thought of guests who may be sleeping in the rooms. Be careful of drivers who increase your trip prices due to extra journeys they suggest you should do. If you are looking for a rustic Sri Lankan experience then this is the hotel for you, as apart from Views we definitely didn’t think this was 5 star!",Negative
"1 Star for the location & view, 1 Star for breakfast buffet, 1 Star for clean, comfortable room.We had very high expectations for this hotel with its mostly excellent reviews & hefty prices - $300 per night is pricey for Sri Lanka (& this wasn’t a top tier room). The room located in the Sigriya wing was very spacious with a modern bathroom & great view. Breakfast had great choices & we really enjoyed both of them - the food that is & not the very ordinary service. They also provided dormitory style accommodation for our driver which he was happy with.This is a big, busy, bustling hotel with large tour groups dominating. The staff just didn’t seem happy & although polite, there was absolutely no warmth or friendliness & zero attempt to do anything except the bare minimum. In our 2 week trip we didn’t experience this anywhere else.We paid way too much for way too little & no we wouldn’t stay here again, sadly.",Negative
"We stayed 3 nights at this hotel. I have mixed feelings about the place as it is in a truly lovely location, with views to die for, but for the price it charges, I expect more. I've taken 2 stars off as I feel the hotel is dated, and in need of some refreshment inside the bedrooms, and around the swimming pool area. The air-conditioning in the room switches off when you remove your keycard, resulting in the room feeling rather hot on your return, and its output does not work sufficiently when it is on. The light switch control behind the bed is confusing. Availability of plugs needs to be increased. For the price one pays, I did not like that toiletries appears to be decanted, and refilled. It did not feel hygienic to me. The view from our bedroom, and other areas from the hotel, was stupendously beautiful, with vistas over the lake towards the Lion rock in the distance. The infinity pool overlooking the lake is also lovely, however it felt and looked a bit dated. It is lovely though with monkeys sometimes making an appearance, although you have to be careful that they don't steal your belongings. I went to have a look at the pool on the 'top deck' one afternoon, but there were nobody overseeing the area, and appeared shut. It was also not very clean. I did not see any signage saying it was not open to guests though.The food was excellent, with lots of choice at the buffet restaurant, although I didn't really see the need for the fancy dress up requirement. Smart casual would be sufficient at a buffet, after a long day sightseeing in hot conditions. We felt tired when we arrived back at the hotel every day, and the thought of having to play dress up was not appealing. I really think the hotel should do away with this. Staff were very helpful, and friendly.",Negative
"The main attraction of this hotel has to be its location; it is just beautiful with views of the lake. Unfortunately, the facilities are looking a bit run-down...the hallways are dark and unattractive and the room furniture could also use an upgrade.The food and breakfast are decent.",Negative
"This is the most confusing review I've ever had to write.The building itself is absolutely incredible. I'm an architecture fan and would happily pay just to go see the building. It's magnificent.In addition we got upgraded to a suite which was lovely.However, the hotel has a strange feel as it's predominantly used by tour parties visiting Sigiriya and Dambulla cave temples and as a result just feels like a transit hotel.The pool areas are nice enough, but don't feel particularly comfortable and in an evening there isn't anywhere to sit for a drink that doesn't just feel like a hotel lobby.The buffet restaurant was fine (food is actually very good) but again felt unwelcoming like a canteen and not somewhere you'd linger over a romantic meal.There are also some things that need attention. Obviously some of windows have been recently repainted in the restaurant, but the masking tape is all over the floor outside the windows. Wouldn't expect that in a 5 star. Plus the rooms do feel a little tired and need freshening up (and if you can work out the light/socket switch combination then I assume you get automatic membership to Mensa!) Plus, for an 'eco' hotel I'm surprised by the amount of plastic water bottles they use. Maybe get some flasks in the rooms that are refilled every day and can request extras? Overall, go if you can get a deal to see the building, but don't stay any longer than a couple of nights. I just don't see it being somewhere anyone would particularly want to go back to.",Negative
"To be honest - we were very much looking forward to spend time at the Heritance. The pictures and the advertising - just everything is so inviting.Therefore, we booked for 7 (!) nights. However, already the start wasn't as expected. There is so much more you can do to let your guest feel welcome. Especially, after the long car ride you'll just have to get to the place! Don't get me wrong - everybody is friendly, but that's it. Looking after your guest and make them feel special (as you might except at a 5 star hotel with extrem high prices) wasn't somehow in there concept. And the worse is, that you constantly feel ripped-off if it comes to paying for something. e.g.trips, the spa or else. We booked an hour of yoga (we can recommend the trainer Lanka very much!). For the second time we asked for an hour earlier - and should have paid double (!!!) the price. Knowing, that we where the only guest booking the yoga class ...All together we left with a somewhat disappointed feeling. I guess they are specialized for bus tourism - one night and get the most out of the customers, because you never see them again. The rooms are very used and defiantly need a renovation. They are clean, but you can tell the moment you walk in, that there are very old and haven't been modernized for ages. Paying our bill at the last day we didn't even got the question if we liked it or not ... we won't be back and unfortunately can not recommend the hotel",Negative
"We stayed three nights here. The hotel itself is very (too?) big, with a lot of unused space when we visited. The rooms are good with nice views out over the lake. Three swimming pools (we used the infinity) and a gym. The a la carte menu was ok but over priced compared to others. Buffet breakfast was reasonable. As ever, the staff were extremely helpful and friendly.",Negative
when you go to one of the top eco hotels in Sri Lanka imagine your horror when you order food to be served frozen French fries this is at a hotel only 15k from the biggest retail fruit and vegetable market in the island in Dambulla why oh why cannot the chefs use fresh potatoes very very lazy,Negative
"We brought our children to Kandalama to enjoy the experience that we had 23 years ago. While the food was just amazing, the rooms were a bit tired. The pool was lovely and the dinner buffet was fantastic.",Negative
We stayed here for 3 nights as part of our recent Sri Lanka road trip and were particularily looking forward to staying at this hotel which my husband had stayed at 20 years ago. We enjoyed our 3 nights but overall were a little disappointed. Our room was tired and in need of upgrade particularly the bathroom and the staff were not as friendly or engaging as we experienced everywhere else we stayed. The exception were the pool staff who were lovely.The buffet breakfast and diner was good but we ate one night in the A La Carte restaurant and found this expensive and lacking in atmosphere.We were very disappointed to see the hotel elephant still being ridden despite earlier claims that this had been stopped.Overall our stay was nice but nothing special which we had hoped for.,Negative
"The place is just beautiful and the food is incredible. This is really a very serene place and you'll love being surrounded by nature and especially the monkeys! However, for calling themselves an ""eco"" hotel, they really need to STOP THE ELEPHANT RIDES. When you walk to the lake, you'll see there is a structure made for climbing the poor elephant. The hotel will say that the elephant rides are not their business but that some person near the hotel runs the elephant ride business. That's not good enough. They can find an ethical, ecological and responsible solution to allowing that elephant to simply be without becoming a victim of exploitation by hotel guests. This is why I am giving this hotel three stars when i could easily give it 5 stars if not for this violation of animal wellbeing. By the way, i'm also a vegetarian.",Negative
"We have mixed feelings about here. A 2 night stay that was a mix of excellent buffet food, coach loads - yes, it isn’t an intimate place at all - of visitors (and an ensuing buffet scrum), dated fixtures and fittings (all very 1960s) in a fabulous location!Arrival and check in did seem a little 1960s James Bond going through the building, and as a piece of architecture the be honest we weren’t very taken by it. The monkeys in the balcony were quite sweet though! Our bathroom was slightly odd where doors opening from the shower/jacuzzi cover the sink area.The staff were friendly, food fantastic and location unbeatable. If you can look beyond the sheer numbers of people then this is a great place to stay.",Negative
"Unfortunately this hotel did not live up to expectations. Our room felt very worn and that it required some maintenance. The restaurant lacks some atmosphere and the buffet food we felt was average (but we are not a huge fan of buffets in the first place). The staff however were excellent and the location is amazing. Being surrounded by nature at such close proximity is very special. It is a good distance to all the tourist sites in the area. Another comment is that for an eco hotel, there was no facility to fill up water bottles, meaning the hotel must go through hundreds of plastic water bottles on a daily basis. Although the rooms have recycling bins, our preference would have been to fill up our own water bottle (this issue is by no means limited to this hotel).",Negative
"Stayed in this hotel for a 1 night stop over. Outside it looks beautiful, but was disappointed with the room. The infinity pool is nice with great views of the lake, the k club sandwich is really good from the cafe shop on the ground floor. Rooms are ok, but was disappointed to have too many bugs flying about and no insect nets surrounding the bed...The selection of foods for dinner and breakfast is superb and the staff are very friendly.",Negative
"Very nice hotel with beautiful view. However there’s room to improve as following :- 1. Beware of the flies and lots of it at night if you feel ok with it. Hence the light turned too dim so not to attract flies. 2. The check in service was slow and don’t make sense , asked you walked so far and sit down to wait for check in and all back same place to my room.. probably they can help to speed up as we arrived late at 8pm and took us 20 more mins just to check us 2 only??? 3. The restaurant food is bad quality and service is disappointing. Felt like rushing you and asked us to pay for dinner which we have paid as part of package. Some waiters don’t understand English well and not able to know what you requested. 4. The breakfast was ok but they need to learn how to make good fruit juice. 5. Upon checking out, again made mistakes to charge me more vs what we have booked. So please check the final price upon checking out and don’t blindly sign any bills here..",Negative
"Came here for our honeymoon. It is breathtaking and like nothing I’ve ever seen. So secluded and tranquil. The facilities were amazing, as was the food and people. The spa was beautiful and the best massage we’ve ever had. However we had one issue after the other which let us down massively. This was the trip of a life time that went spend a lot of money on and didn’t want to be bothered with any issues. Our sink plug kept keeping stuck down by the cleaner and left therefore we had to call at least 3 times and wait to get it fixed. Our sink leaked onto the floor which mean it was constantly wet. There service at lunch one day was very slow. Then the hot water in the hotel broke and we were left waiting for it to be fixed all night. We eventually complained and got moved so a suite, however this was the last night and of no use as the shower they fitted in this room had to be hand held. The view from this room was not as nice as the initial one and the whole thing was just a big inconvenience. My husband was also not allowed into the restaurant with smart shorts but was allowed with joggies... Our issue with this was we weren’t even pre warned. There was more small issues not worth mentioning. I do believe this was jut bad luck! The place was amazing and the people helpful. To say sorry we got all our dinners removed front the bill. Overall we loved it but for a honeymoon we were completely let down.",Negative
"Enjoyed the beauty of natural forests sceneries, birds songs, and wild monkeys. Restaurants are fine, good food, good variety. Limited space for vehicle parking, with less security for cars (possible monkey attacks). Rooms are bit old and small, But clean and neat.",Negative
"We stayed for two nights in a deluxe king room. Our welcome was from a very unfriendly pathetic sole who had been in the job far two long. We sat at reception waiting for our key and was confronted by the F&B manager asking if we wanted to book a special cave dinner for $600 USD! Really!! Our room thankfully had an amazing view but the rest needed a good clean especially the spa bath and windows. Basically the hotel is looking extremely tired, dirty and needs some serious maintenance along with the out door areas, the infinity pool could also do with a good scrub to get rid of all the algae growing around the edges. On a positive note the breakfast had a great selection and the bar staff were very friendly and made great cocktails. We also had a spa treatment which was fantastic by two Balinese ladies who were so friendly. The price of this hotel is really not justified, it is a very big hotel with many guests which has lost its charm.",Negative
"We stayed here for two nights on tour of Sri Lanka, initial reception was nice and polite rooms are lovely , however after that the staff just don’t care and are borderline rude. We tried to order food in the restaurant and were met with the challenge are you staying here when we clarified we where it never got any better. The staff loiter and just don’t leave you alone even if you are making calls etc , overall a disappointing stay. At breakfast we had to ask for cutlery and napkins they only brought over 3 sets for 4 people. Certainly a lovely building however the staff let the place down.",Negative
"I was disappointed when I arrived with the outdated decor. For a 5* hotel this was not up to scratch. Also the staff service was not that great. I have been to other Heritance hotels in Sri Lanka which were definitely 5* material. The food was ok, but the restaurant staff were not that great. For the price charged this was not worth it. Definitely needs an uplift to match the view outside. The staff needs to trained to meet current customer service standards. The view surrounding the hotel is stunning and wild monkeys are beautiful and well behaved. Never feed them....Hopefully this hotel will change to meet other Heritance hotel standards.",Negative
"When a hotel be in business of hospitality for almost 30 years you tend to believe that they are proficient. In case of Heritance Kandalama its utter disgrace and heartbreaking to see such a fine establishment which I in person have ecstatic memories of more than 18years goes to disintegration over last few years.Online booking is a total scam. There were offers up to 30% on early online booking displayed on the official web site and when I booked it almost a month prior only 10% discount. Wrote an email to relevant department never bothered to even reply!Booked for FB but booking went through as HB, contacted hotel and assured that they would correct it on arrival. Upon arrival informed the matter in simple language only they nod their heads. But crummy front office and reservation staff didn’t change the booking from HB to FB.Thanks to a friend who was a previous employ got an upgrade.Room is nice and clean with stunning view. Bedding was acceptable but if you want have to ask for different pillows. Tea coffee making facilities were limited as also the in room entertainment options.Plenty of outdoor activities with three wonderful pools. Has a joyful environment with live bands.Food was great as usual for most of the group hotels.Apart from few restaurant staff was dreadful, most of them didn’t care for the locals. They took their time to attend to locals’ needs. It’s an interesting phenomenon yet I would like to enlighten the management that it’s best to treat everyone equally and keep in mind that locals may revisit if they were treated appropriately.",Negative
Me and my family had a booking for one day . So we went there around 3pm . Then I had to stay in the lobby 2hours at least .In a warm hot day al least without a refreshment . As 5star hotel I think they should have to do much better service than this.,Negative
"This is a real get away Hotel from it all, The Hotel is centered in the middle of the jungle with nature right on your balcony and stunning views. I was very impressed with how it integrates into the rock and structure and blends well .The room was good , comfortable and like many Sri Lankan properties not fussy with amenties. A great infinity pool which is ideal for sunset ...Food and beverage is of a good standard and reasonable.] My only real gripe would be the staff... whilst do their jobs with a robotic sense , they are not in any way friendly , very few smiles, more like stares ..Front desk need a lesson in meet and Greet as there was little interaction.Only one chap who was our waiter was friendly and was super in ensuring good service with a smile..it is a pity as this is a fantastic property, maybe the staff are being overworked and disengaged by management.",Negative
"It's a amazing yet calm and quite hotel to relax mind from busy work schedule. I really enjoyed the amazing rooms with a splendid view. But little bit crowded at dinner time since it was seasonal vacation I suppose. So bit noisy and less tidy though. However, overall food was so so delicious and wide variety of food were available.Room service and the staff were nice and friendly and took care of our needs. Indeed it was a pleasure to visit Heritance Kandalama !",Negative
"Overall the stay was good. Unfortunately, we had an unpleasant experience during our stay. During the peak period please make sure that you have enough room in your dining area to serve all the guests (in case they all turn up around the same time). We had been indicated to eat our dinner soon to allow other guests to have their dinner. This is the first time we had such an experience. This is not acceptable for a 5-star hotel. We were travelling with 2 kids (1 year and 3 years) and there was no baby pool in the hotel! The location is excellent. Love the views and monkeys and everything else. The quality of food was excellent.",Negative
"During the first day I was calling them twice, answered and transferred the call no one has pick it up. Their is no information regarding dress code ar dinner, after went to the restaurant they said so.",Negative
"Heritance Kandalama is certainly a beautiful place with amazing views. They left us a lovely cake to celebrate our anniversary which we really appreciated. Our room overlooked the beautiful lake so it had a stunning view and the room itself was clean and comfortable. The infinity pool was also stunning, however it is surrounded by a muddy area so expect muddy feet in the pool. We were disappointed with a few things, only because we expect more from a 5* hotel: -We chose this hotel because it was on a vegan blog. We informed the hotel well in advance of our dietary needs however they were quite unhelpful at times. At dinner we were told everything that we could eat, which was great, but then at lunchtimes we were basically told that we couldn't eat anything. This was because the snack menu and in-room dining menus were the only ones available. They were not willing to make minor adjustments, such as swapping the butter bun for standard bread or a wrap which we could eat. It was really difficult to communicate the vegan issue on several occasions. Whilst we appreciate that not everyone is familiar with veganism, we were written an email which said they would cater for us. -The fixtures were old and rusted and the bath tub was not cleaned properly. I definitely didn't want a Jacuzzi bath in there. -The staff did not seem particularly happy with an unfriendly demeanour about many of them. - on one occasion when we called for help about a takeaway breakfast, we were passed on to different people about 5 times because no one understood English well enough. Surely you would pass on to someone who does know English in the first instance? We did end up getting our breakfast which was thoughtfully packed with our vegan needs in mind. - the men only addressed my husband and usually ignored me, so only my husband got the 'good morning's etc. I suppose this is cultural, but with most guests being British I would expect less sexism. - the man who seemed to be in charge of the restaurant by the pool was particularly unhelpful. Any time we asked for something he would forget to get back to us (this happened 3 times at least). We asked whether we could order chips etc and he said he would find out but never got back to us. We wasted a lot of time waiting on him. - there is a gross shortage of sun loungers.  We often went on the hunt for one but were unsuccessful. It's worth staying here for the spectacular views. But it's short of 5* service.",Negative
"Do not pay more than $200 USD for a deluxe room . We paid $350 6 months in advance and complained and comped a dinner. Everything is ++ as well silly policy in a modern hotel,still worth staying here Great location,awesome views.",Negative
"Total highlights were the monkeys on the balcony of a morning, and the generous if dark bedroom and bathroom. Considering this amazing construction is clinging to rock and jungle in a remote spot it was a shade too busy when you hit the yet again buffet. Waiters were great though. Bun fight if you join a chef point cooking queue. The problem is you get so easily lost on the very long open (but rear facing) landings/stairs/lifts/and rather poor pools. Has a Safari feel but you have to like concrete construction. Thought the cocktail bars were very uninteresting.",Negative
"Our room had fantastic views over the lake, however this also meant were in a separate landing furthest away from any of the hotel amenities. It is an eco friendly hotel within a forest which we liked, but if bugs are not your thing, this will be a hard place to stay at. We stayed at this hotel over Christmas and they were clearly very busy and it showed in the service received. We found the food to be average at best which was tricky as the hotel is located quiet far away from town.",Negative
The best thing about this hotel is the View across what seems like a Game Park Vista superb panoramic views and very rural they even have bird watching trips within the grounds....The Hotel is designed to wrap along the rock face hence its far too long if your at the end far to much to be expected to walk if you are booked into here for anything longer than a few days. The rooms and hotel design was probably ground breaking in the sixties or seventies but this hotel is so dated and very tired the rooms are knocked around to bits the hotel needs a re-vamp.....not worthy of the price they charge.The hotel has 3 pools as its so long. The infinity pool has a great view over the edge but its very deep and no good for swimmers who art that confident or young children...but the biggest letdown is the area around the pool....not very big not enough sun beds and absolutely no shade or umbrellas and the sun is baking !! so you can't stay out long....the area around the pool hasn't been landscaped and doesn't look like what a top hotel would provide. The second pool is very close but higher up...foget it ! Its small filthy no body uses it and is full of monkeys taking a bath and fornicating. The third pool is at the very far end...not very good....all pools very dissapointing with no bar facilities present at all you have to go into the hotel....very poor.The Restaurant is Ok provides a reasonable buffet and it has a bar area but not an ambient inviting place to spend a nice evening. The hotel has vacant vast rooms with nothing in them which gives the hotel a vacant derelict feel....never felt comfortable in this hotel or clean in the rooms....you have been warned !....Its desperate for a re-vamp. No where near a 5 star or 4 star hotel.,Negative
"From the moment we booked our tour of Sri-Lanka this was the hotel I was most looking forward to staying at. Whilst not a total disaster it just didn't live up to the other Heritance hotels we stayed with. This is due to many factors, it is very long which is advertised but to get anywhere takes an age and is not that well lit in places. The pool areas were well served by the lifeguards but very limited. Our room whilst very clean and well stocked was so dark, no lighting in the wardrobe and by the case stand, this made picking out clothes etc. difficult. I understand there is foliage cascading down the building but a little more light in the rooms would not go amiss. We had a problem getting coffee one evening after dinner, to cut a long story short after mentioning this they did there best to rectify the situation. However next morning at breakfast the whole of the restaurant staff had clearly been briefed on the situation, we were made to feel very uncomfortable with over attentive service and a man standing just feet away all the time, constantly asking us if the coffee was ok and did we want anymore. I understand staff wanting to correct a situation but sometimes efforts to do so need to be balanced so as not to make the customer feel uncomfortable. We found the room service staff and front of house staff very helpful and despite our experience which clearly doesn't happen to everyone this is still a nice place to visit for a night or two.",Negative
"This hotel is dated, despite being a Geoffrey Bawa designed building, we found the long distances from room to central areas a bit inconvenient having only two night there. The room was small and dark, with no light over the luggage bench so it was difficult to find things in the case.The a la carte restaurant was dingy with no atmosphere , and the food was only ok.The buffet restaurant was more buzzy but the service was very haphazard and not friendly. The position is spectacular and the views are great but that is not enough to make me want to come back or recommend it . The best thing about the whole experience was the spa. The Spa manager, delightful Nepalese girl (Irishi?) is very friendly and effervescent and so, having climbed Sigiriya that day , I was encouraged to have a massage , which was one of the best, most relaxing ever. The therapist was Balinese and had a fantastic technique. I then had a free yoga nidra session with the resident guru, Lanka, who made the whole experience worthwhile. Had it not been for the massage, spa and yoga experience it would have been hard for me to say anything positive about Heritance.",Negative
"There's no doubt this is one of the nicest eco hotels in the midst of wilderness in Sri Lanka. Staff were very friendly and hotel is geared for buffet meals where a good selection of food is offered. However I can not say the same for their Ala Carte menu where I ordered a hot dog for my son in the afternoon which cost me nearly US$19 and it came with a 2 inch frank cut in half in a dry bun! Yes this experience doesn't do the justice to the overall experience at the hotel, but certainly would like to warn the other travellers not to make the same mistake!The hotel view is so serene during the day but could feels bit spooky at night which should be expected in a location of this nature!",Negative
The situation is stunning with views over the lake and after our first Heritance hotel hoped this would be as good.There were 3 weddings taking place on our arrival so the nicest pool area was not for general use. The hotel seems rather tired and our room was dark and nearly the furthest from reception.We did find a quiet pool to relax and were entertained by a family of monkeys.After reading reviews we were disappointed by the food served in a large and noisy restaurant.,Negative
"The hotel’s architecture is breathtaking and the rooms / restaurants offer amazing views. However, we found the rooms to be a bit dated and service not up to scratch (Long-wait for check-in and check-out, no one took note of our requests prior to check-in despite email confirmations and general lack of responsiveness)... Internet connection was very weak. It’s good enough if you’re looking for a place to stay around Dambulla but not as good as we expected it to be.",Negative
"The 'Great' is the building itself. Stunning...(Bawa would however be annoyed by the crass blue tv screens either side of the bar, advertising some drink, and perhaps the TV in there should be removed...not really in the spirit of the architecture!)The 'Pretty good' is the welcome, and how they handle a mass of clients. The buffet, whilst not world class, is more than adequate. Service ok. The hotel gets lots of people dropping by - so can feel overtly touristic.The 'Appalling' is their so called premium restaurant - which is meant to have an Australian chef (is he still around???). Having booked a table for four, we were given a round one for six. It took a while to convince the staff to remove the additional chairs and place settings. No major issue. What was a major issue was a very long wait for food - and then three of our meals arriving - the fourth (my curry) arrived over ten minutes later.Alas, things got worse - the white mullet was dry slabs of overcooked fish which were stone cold, It was accompanied by a commercially bought mayonnaise, to which some garlic and lemon was added. What supposedly top league restaurant doesn't make its own mayonnaise??? My vegetarian curry, was a chicken one which I sent back - (accompanied by some vegetable ones).... Staff were friendly, working hard, but with no senior direction.We asked for a manager who came from the buffet restaurant, and apologised and offered the kids some free ice cream. We weren't after a discount just genuinely upset by the atrocious quality of, well everything.At the end of the meal, we were told we only had to pay for our wine and the meal was free...I thought this over-generous, but smiled and thanked them. Next morning upon our check out, I found we had been charged for the meal, with a 20% discount! I didn't complain - life is too short. But someone who knows about food and service needs to take control.",Negative
"My whole experience at this hotel was disappointing. The hotel setting is beautiful but that has little to do with the hotel itself. The Heritance Kandalama is outdated, old hotel.The service was friendly but not really attentive. That’s no surprise because it’s hard to be attentive if you’re dealing with mass of people. The Heritance Kandalama is in my opinion a pass through hotel, just to stay overnight or if you’re out and about the whole day, you come back to the hotel,take a shower, eat and sleep then move on the next day.The food is okay, nothing special. There is a big buffet, with quite a lot of choices.My opinion:very overrated hotel.",Negative
"The hotel is located in a beautiful setting. It is at a lake, nestled along the rock and surrounded by a forrest. This is the highlight of the hotel. When you are interested in architecture you will also like the design which was excellent 25 years ago. But that is also where the problems start as the hotel has been untouched since and desperately needs renovation.The staff is friendly but not attentive as you are just one of the thousands of guests the hotel sees coming and going all the time. Most guests stay one to three nights for their trips to the sights nearby. And the hotel has this very atmosphere, in particular in the dining hall where you feel like in an airport restaurant as busy as it is with the stuff having the same attitude. When you have booked half board you have to eat from the buffet. The table cloth is rarely clean, and in case you want a second plate the waiters leave the same cutlery for you to use for the next dish, which i have never experienced before even in the very few hotels with a buffet option. The quality of the food however was quite good, at least when you stick to curries as we did. There is a wide selection of main courses and desserts with a small selection of cheese.Given the reputation of the hotel it has been a disappointment. However if you look for a great location with an average hotel to sleep before going on your sightseeing trips while traveling Sri Lanka you may consider he heritance Kandalama.",Negative
"I stayed for two nights at Heritance Kandalama with my boyfriend. We were quite disappointed for a number of reasons - the room was certainly oversold, we asked for a panorama room and there was not really a view, the room was quite small and shabby/dirty too. We asked to move so we spent our second night in a better room however this didn’t make up for the overpriced food and slow service. If you stay I would recommend using tuk tuk service rather than the hotel car and picking up food in the nearby dambulla town. The best things about the hotel are it’s design, the wildlife, and the location which are all amazing. I think for the price though, you don’t get the quality.",Negative
"The hotel is a fascinating place to stay for its architectural interest and aspirations to be eco friendly, however, it is showing signs of age and looks like it could do with a serious refresh. Things in the room look a little tired, for example balcony door locks have been replaced in a shoddy way and the air con is very noisy and difficult to control. We walked down to where paper is made and spotted the single lone elephant chained up. Although it looked well cared for, with hind sight, keeping one elephant on its own is probably not a very kind thing to do and probably just for the tourists. The infinity swimming pool is spectacular but somewhat spoiled when you look over the edge and see plastic and a bit of mess around it. Food from the hotel buffet is good enough, but not spectacular. Friendly and obliging staff. In summary, it is an interesting place to stay but very expensive and we had a better time elsewhere for less money.",Negative
The hotel itself is huge and is dominated by large coach tour groups. The room we had was an upgrade to a suite. Very large with a huge bathroom. Clean but make sure you put the plugin anti mosquito unit on we didn’t find it until the 2nd day. Beware of monkeys getting into the room if you leave the balcony door is left un locked. The main dinning room is massive with a buffet. The ambience is terrible as it is a barn of a building and becomes very noisy and echoes when the tour groups all start talking. The food was un exciting and when something was finished the plates were not replenished promptly. There is a ridiculous clause saying smart casual. This hotel needs to rethink how they treat the dinning options. We arrived early in the evening and told our only option was the buffet. They need to look at smaller places to eat where you can have a conversation with your partner without needing to shout. We felt like a captive audience as there are no real options unless you drive miles.,Negative
"This was a nice hotel in the sense that the room was as expected the view of the lake lovely the infinity pool was nice what it lacked was atmosphere of any sort, which is not a criticism of the staff or the place in general but honestly apart from the wildlife side of things I felt like I was in an asylum! If you are in to eco hotels and total zen style holiday this would be for you, we only stayed here one night whilst visiting sigiriya and that would have been enough for me. The monkeys around the place are entertaining, don't stay here at all if you don't get on well with bugs.",Negative
"The hotel is known for his excellent work by Jeoffry Bawa. It is amazing to see how he had used the space and the jungle to have natural experience. Eventhough the hotel got nearly 150 rooms (if I’m not mistaken) you don’t feel it until you go to the dining area or reception. The staff is excellent and doing their best undoubtedly.Only negative thing and the biggest concern for me is how the construction badly affected to the insects and other animals. You can see thousands of insects dies everyday. I have heard lot s birds are killed too. Of course the hotel can be named as a “Nature Resort” but not as a “Eco Friendly Hotel”. If you are Nature and Wildlife sensitive person, this is not the right place.",Negative
"Stayed here for 2 nights during our tour of Sri Lanka. As everyone else has said before, the location is truly stunning. But that's about as good as it gets. Our standard (or premium as it was labelled) room was tired, dark. scruffy and a long way from the restaurants (10+ mins walk) but had excellent views of the lake and sunset. We were booked for half board as we knew it was a long drive anywhere to eat out in the evening. The restaurant (aka works canteen) was noisy with kids running up and down and tour groups on large tables shouting across tables at each other. Breakfast was standard fare but no fresh juices, only cordials. Had egg hoppers first morning which I enjoyed and hoped to have again 2nd morning but no, not an option. Went for an omelette and watched as the ""egg chef"" on duty was instructed how to make an omelette by another chef. And he still made a mess of it with an overcooked bottom and runny top! Dinner was not much better with lukewarm (at best) tasteless food, a far cry from the Heritance Negombo which we'd stayed at the night before. We were offered a discount at the a la carte for the second night so we thought we'd give that ago but it was empty, completely silent (no background music) with staff hovering around us. Mr W's steak (which he'd asked for cooked medium) could have been brought back to life with a decent set of jump leads whereas my pork was overcooked and dry. Then they brought the bill with no promised discount and it took 3 staff members to sort it out.One positive was the friendly barman who made us cocktails on the first night however due to a reason which we still don't know about, no alcohol was served at all on the 2nd night in the hotel. We knew there was a full moon a couple of days later so we would be unable to get any then but there was no notice put in reception or in the restaurant warning us of this and believe me when you're looking forward to getting back to the hotel with a cold beer after a hot 11 hour day of touring and climbing Sigiriya it's not really appreciated!In summary this hotel has a long way to go before it can call itself 5*",Negative
"The staff are very friendly, prompt & service oriented- you really can not fault them.The breakfast is excellent - a lot of choice of both western & Sri Lankan cuisine, fresh & delicious.The hotel is situated on a lake & most rooms have good views.The hotel room and bathroom are disappointing for a hotel of this standard/ price and are tired looking. There is a feature wall in the room & it just makes the room feel dark and some of the furniture has definitely seen better days.Could definitely do with an update.There is no iron in the room & the power points look unsafe.Wifi is complimentary & good.",Negative
"Situated in an absolutely fabulous surrounding on the banks of a lake and overlooking the famous Sigriya rock,is this eco friendly hotel, which must have been concieved as a very special hotel by its promoters. As a property it is everything one would conceptually expect from an expensive (325$++) offering. However, one feels like entering into a large tourist insensitive cruise ship, where check in took as much as an hour and the arrogance of the duty manager was apparent when questioned about the delay..The same arrogance exuded in the restaurant , where the waiter started by suggesting our only choice was the buffet till challenged and then he surfaced an alacarte menu card. A fitting example the proves that unless staff are taught to be attentive, empathetic and not too quick in saying no, the best of places will turn to ruin.Mr. GM, please wake up and view this as a heads up.A passing point is that the differences in the different rooms on offer should be clearer so that informed decisions can be made by potential clients.",Negative
"On check in we were informed that our booking could not be located. Despite being able to provide a copy of our (prepaid) booking confirmation we were essentially accused of using a dodgy travel agent and were repeatedly told the hotel did not have our booking.We were left in the heat for more than an hour, weren't offered drinks and were repeatedly reminded that this was our fault for not booking with the hotel directly.Finally we were allowed to check-in to the room we had booked (Panoramic Room) at almost double the price. By the time we were finally shown to the room the sun had set and we were unable to see the view that we had chosen the hotel for. We were told we have to have breakfast included (we would have left the hotel before breakfast opened to climb Sigiriya) despite having originally booked the room only. Again we were treated as liars as this apparently wasn't an option.We had forwarded the confirmation email to the front desk staff who said on multiple occasions that they would respond to confirm that they did not have the reservation so we could have a record if required. We were also told that wi-fi passwords would be sent to the room with the bag. Neither happened.About an hour after we were settled into our room we were called to say they had finally thought to check with their online reservation team and the booking had been located. When we asked why they hadn't done this originally they could not respond. We did not receive an apology just a closing line on the call of ""and you can't have breakfast on this booking"". Apparently we weren't liars after all.We asked to speak to the manager the next day about the way check-in was handled and were again told that the hotel would not apologise for the way we had been treated by them, we shouldn't have used a booking site that wasn't the hotel directly.The spa, the a la carte restaurant and the view were all fantastic. But the horrible reception to the hotel cannot be forgotten and I would not recommend it to a friend.A good hotel is one that deals with the hiccups well, and the Heritance has a lot to learn. This hotel was the only disappointment of our 3 weeks in Sri Lanka.",Negative
"My wife and I stayed for 2 nights on our recent honeymoon tour of Sri Lanka. The pictures and reviews looked amazing so we were very excited for our stay. Staff were courteous and polite at check in and we headed to our room...On arrival at our room I wasn't particularly impressed. There was a musty aroma, dirty windows and blinds and quite a tired looking bathroom suite, not terrible but not particularly impressive at the same time. Food was good and we enjoyed decent breakfasts and evening meals. After that we thought about retiring to the bar to watch my wife's favourite football team play on the advertised ""giant screen"" in the bar. Said giant screen was a small box telly I'd have chucked in a skip 10 years ago and the bar is devoid of warmth or atmosphere as it's essentially a wide bit of the corridor. That being said for all my moaning it's a beautiful spot and you can't help but be wowed by the surroundings. I can understand how people have had a great stay here but personally I think it lacks value for money and is in need of investment to bring it up to its advertised standard. Moan over 😊",Negative
"Location: Absolutely beautifulRooms: Needs updating. Didn't have a flatscreen tv. Instead had an old Phillips tv(the fat kind). (Room 333The bathroom blinds and sink looked grubby and old. Shower was slightly wonky so water would spray in all directions.Rest of the hotel: furniture looks dated( the wooden stuff). The wrought iron and brass furniture is fine as with all signature Bawa interiors. This place has so much potential to be great yet sadly falls short.Lounge: Again huge space which is in dire need of updating. Sofa s and cushions are so old and uncomfortable.Service: Much to be desired. Most staff can't speak simple English. E.g.: the girl selling jams in the lobby, most of the servers in the restaurant couldn't coherently respond when addressed in English. Staff would smile but it wasn't a gracious genuin smile.Pools: Nice enough, though when we went up to the rock pool on the 7th floor, it seemed like it had not been cleaned as there was lots of debris in it.Restaurant: the fools was very good, with a wide selection for FB buffet. However felt that the restaurant seating was insufficient to handle the fully booked hotel. Also, until we checked in, no one mentioned that dinner required men to wear pants/ sarong. A silly requirement and one that is poorly communicated. We traveled as a group, and had a hard time finding space in the dining area at dinner. In fact we had to stand outside waiting till people had their dinner and left in order to occupy free tables. Again, poor management by the staff to ensure guests had ready tables.Overall: Apart from the food and location, the hotel was a bit of a let down. Having being to many other Bawa properties, seeing this hotel in this state was quite disappointing .",Negative
"we were there for 2 nights....the hotel seemed fine but we were probably unlucky to get the worst room....on checking into the room we found the pot had something used tissue paper in it....the housekeeper cleaned it but a little later while trying to charge my phone the power went off and kept flickering for two days after that....the roomfloor was full of scratches and looked like it needed relaying ,same with the bathroom tiles....but the saving grace of the place was the prompt service and out of the world quality of food....they had ample variety and were delicious as well....the property is real nice ,well looked after but so big that getting to the room was a pain....",Negative
"This hotel is located by the lake and the building is excellent. But the staff seems too overwhelmed by too many guests so a single guest like me got ignored, no welcome drink and I have to wait for 10 minutes before check in while a big group arrived after me went to their room right away. The staff has no smile and unfriendly,,,,",Negative
"We were looking forward to our stay at Heritance Kandalama, but sadly one thing after another left us disappointed. Our room wreaked of smoke. We complained to the front desk and asked to switch rooms. Unlucky for us, the hotel was 99% full and the only other room available had a similar musky/ smoky smell, but without our view. They offered to spray something to mask the smell, but in our experience this makes it even worse, so we declined. We went for a swim hoping to air out the room in the meantime, but the pool was ice cold! We sucked it up and swam for 20 minutes until we couldn’t bear the cold anymore. The cold pool was slightly made up for with hot towels waiting for us when we got out. The highlight of the room was their rain shower that had floor to ceiling windows that overlooked the jungle and lake. Great pressure and you could also turn on their sound system that played sounds of wildlife in the shower, so you felt like you were showering in the jungle. Pretty cool and definitely something we loved. They do not have conditioner though, so bring your own from home if you need that. After we showered we went to the main dining room that served food buffet style which was completely packed and loud—not the vibes we wanted for a relaxing dinner. They did have an a la carte restaurant in the hotel, which we went to after, but there was an hour wait and we were staving. That left us with the lobby dining option. The food was okay and service was a tad off. My fiancé didn’t like his drink and when he asked for something different the waiter looked at him like he had seven heads. At the end of the day, he got a new drink and the waiter was friendly. Maybe it was a cultural thing, but for a 4/5 star hotel we expected the standard to be higher. Secondly, we got engaged right before our trip and my fiancé had e-mailed every hotel we were staying at to let them know/ coordinate something special. Here there was no mention of our special occasion. While we don’t need a cake that says “happy engagement” we were confused by the lack of attention to detail at a “5-star hotel”. The grounds itself were beautiful, so the hotel definitely has potential to be great. Service was just a little off and the restaurant options need enhancement.",Negative
"The hotel was situated in an amazing location.The pool was realy eye catching.Food also very taste.But the staff wasn't familier with their customers.They were in very official way. In breaf,hotel was amazing.",Negative
"This hotel is different totally eco friendly as long as you can get over monkeys watching you shower it is worth a visit.The staff member who showed us round disappointed us by saying "" You can tip me now Sir""!!! Not a great start. The rooms are nice but dark not enough lighting. Food was good, as this is so out of the way it would have been good to be told if anything was going on in the hotel but we had no idea. The building is a little confusing but once you get used to it it is OK",Negative
"I went to the Heritance Kandalama to experience Bawa architecture with my partner. We are both architects and had been looking very much forward to our stay. The location, scenery and architecture is splendid, definitely worth seeing. The atmosphere at the hotel however was quite disappointing and very unlike the Sri Lanka we had experienced while traveling around the island for 3 weeks. I would recommend having lunch and perhaps a swim at the hotel, but you get much more value for your money at other resorts and hotels in the area.",Negative
"I just stayed 2 nights at Kandalama and I like to give my feedback in brief. positives - Staff are very helpful and nice, Food in the hotel is great, hotel is very unique setting and nice change from conventional hotels. negatives - badly need refurbishment, I stayed in luxury room in sigiriya wing, room is good size but boy toilet has mould, WC stain marks, had a tub with cracks and marks didnt want to get in to that, linen worn out and discolored, rooms look really tired and badly need refurbishment I will not call this 5 star, as a local i paid a less money so for what i paid I will not complain about. there are 3 managers, GM, Operations and Residence but I did not see none of them doing walk about and talking to guests just a little hello hi how are you talk would be nice, there is a issue one day pool ran out of towels at 10am?? not acceptable, I would prefers more hand on managers than in your office type people. summer - would i reccomend to anyone well not until they refurbish the rooms and will not come back either until them",Negative
Amazing location and views. Infinity pool was lovely but slightly noisy with lots of children. Felt the rooms were slightly outdated however the bathroom was beautiful and you could shower looking out at the views. Buffet was overpriced for what it was. Room service a la carte was much better. Had a massage in the spa which was amazing. Overall good stay and enjoyed watching the monkeys!,Negative
"A beautiful place that has so much potential. It's like a step back in time to the early 90's and it's clear that not much has been updated since then. We admired the views and architecture but were uncomfortable in our rooms which we expected to be perfectly clean and fresh considering the hotels reputation.Lacked that homely feel that all great hotels have. We hope they can turn it around because the place is amazing. As for now, it's about the best example of how to spoil the unspoilable.",Negative
"Heritance Kandalama is an Eco-hotel, an architectural masterpiece, which was the crown jewel among Sri Lankan hotels. This is perhaps the fourth or fifth time, the last occasion several years ago, that I have stayed in this hotel. I was disappointed this time, because I felt it had lost its charm, though it still remains a unique hotel as far as the room amenities and food quality is concerned. The main reason, I felt was the attitude of indifference among staff, from the time of checking-in, through the restaurant, pool and to check-out. I hope you will get your act right soon and make it the best again.",Negative
"For those that have enjoyed 5-Star accommodation in Europe, Americas, Australia or the Middle East you will be disappointed. The hotel needs to have one star removed until it picks up its game. Whilst there is no question that this hotel is aesthetically beautiful this to the credit of Sri Lanka's most famous architect and not hotel management. Our bathroom after two days of cleaning looked like our bathroom at home if I let my 5yo son run amuck for the week. Hotel staff 9/10 and no question that the food is the best you will get in the region, but also the most unnecessarily expensive. The hotel's last makeover was in 2005 and probably 2yrs overdue for its next. Locals may think this is high class, but traveled foreigners will be disappointed with looking at breathtaking views through dirty windows and touching filthy tap ware & bench tops. Architect Geoffrey Bawa Would be turning in his grave.",Negative
"Service and staff is very good. nice swimming pool, very nice view. booked delux room at 5th floor. As I remember room number 512. commode looks very old and ugly looking. Television was not located in good position to watch, Breakfast time, I went to have a mango juice and they labled as Mango. but it was artificial.",Negative
"Sadly my anticipated excitement of staying at this hotel was not matched by the actual experience. I'll start with the positive, the location is pretty amazing set as it is literally designed and built with the jungle growth and rock face entering into the hotel corridors, balconies and communal areas. And it was amazing waking on th first morning to a group of black faced monkeys feeding in the jungle tree tops just a few yards away from the room. The resident monkeys were at home on your balcony which was lovely. Further positive was the food, both breakfast and dinner. Huge choice of buffet and an outside cooking area with everything changing on a daily basis. I would think that even the most fussy of diners would find something to please and satisfy.The negatives - when this hotel was first constructed with its amazing and imaginative use of the natural surroundings I am sure it was incredible but sadly I don't think much money has been spent on it since. The bedrooms are dated and darkly furnished with appalling lighting, pillows old and lumpy and the towels need renewing. One occasion smelt as if dried in the proximity of a fryer. Internally the whole hotel could do with redecorating using white paint to bring in some light. Externally the hotel is not particularly attractive but it is what it is. The three pool areas however are beyond awful with nowhere enough beds, of the three evening's we stayed we sat by and used the 'natural' pool, so called because it has been constructed utilizing the existing rock in parts. This makes actual swimming a dangerous activity as I wonder how many have injured their legs as there is no way of k owing how far beneath the surface the rock is.In summary this hotel needs serious money spent on an update or give the location back to the jungle and monkeys",Negative
"its an excellent hotel. u wont find another like this one sri lanka. but guys security treats you based on ur vehicle. if you're going by a luxury vehicle, its ok then the guards even salute you. but if you travel by a motorbike like a backpacker, they stop you and ask a million questions like you're going to rob the hotel. really hated that",Negative
"I had high hopes on Heritance Kandalama. I am always fascinated about its architecture. Check in - It was very easy and we got a warm welcome. It was hazel free. I love the Cinnamon drink they offered as a welcome drink.Rooms - I booked Heritance Kandalama through their official website. I booked a room with a bathtub. Once we entered to the room I realized its quite small and basic and no view at all. This is 2nd floor. All the furniture and the amenities (including TV), has seen better days and now all those are just there. Wifi was terrible. With the price I have paid, room is not worth at all. Food - Good spread of buffet. And surprisingly they had cous cous for dinner. Food was nice, but nothing spectacular.",Negative
"The Property is very dramatic,set into rocks and dripping in foliage and vines. Great position. Unfortunately things went a bit wrong from the start,no early check in as agreed,a complete mess up of the booking ( through Booking.com ) and an EXTREMELY loud children's /staff party going on. The service in the bar and by the pool was very poor,due to guess what,that party. The evening buffet partly rescued this visit,the food was excellent and so were the staff. The buffet breakfast was also good as was the staff.I understand that sometimes things go wrong but it is a mark of a good Hotel of how they deal with it. In this case this was not 5 star treatment nor 5 star service. A shame because this hotel has huge potential.",Negative
We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights. The pool is lovely and the view of the lake is fantastic but the service is very poor. The dining room staff are slow and when asking for coffee and other things we were completely ignored. We also didnt have any towels in our room the second day and we had to ask housekeeping twice to bring them. Also at arriving to dinner we had to wait for 20-30 minutes to be seated. Too bad the poor service spoils the hotel.,Negative
"The architecture and views are stunning, the public open spaces are to me a bit disjointed, however they are spacious and comfortable. These areas are 5 star.However, the standard of the rooms we and our friends were in account for the 3 star rating, they were in our opinion in much need of updating, some of the taps were corroded, the lever for the toilet cistern was also corroded, not enough power points and also not as clean as you would expect of a facility of this standard.",Negative
This hotel is 1km from end to end so you spend a long time walking from room to pool to restaurant etc. The rooms are extremely small and basic with almost no hanging space and very little light. Power cuts are frequent but short lived.The buffet restaurant is packed (usually with big parties) and the food is very average (beef both cold and hot was inedible) but the a la carte restaurant is good.There is a lovely infinity pool (one of the best we've seen) with a distant view of Sigiriya Rock but there are only about 10 sun beds there. There is another roof top pool but that only has about 6 sun beds. Clearly this is not enough for a hotel with 150 rooms even allowing for the fact that many people go out and about each day.,Negative
We only stayed one night and arrived in rain so no view. A pleasant welcome .The hotel is built into the rock face and is very spread out. Our room was at one end of the hotel the restaurants were a long walk at the opposite end of the hotel. Our room was nicely appointed overlooking the back of the hotel but we were not able to open the patio doors because of the monkeys which had broken the outdoor terrace chairs! The buffet at dinner had good choices but I found the main dishes I chose quite bland.the next morning the sun was shining and the views over the lake were beautiful. we did enjoy the cultural Kandian Dancers.,Negative
"The things that make this hotel are the location/view, which is stunning across the lake, the staff, who were all so friendly, attentive, and helpful, and the food, which was a huge choice and delicious. In the first room we were given, the bathroom and toilet had grubby, old, disgusting stains all over it, like they'd been there for years. When we complained, we were moved to another room, which was only marginally better. The rooms need a total refurb.The restaurant staff were very helpful and attentive of special dietary requirements,and couldn't have done more for us during our stay.",Negative
"My husband and I stayed at Heritance Kandalama for 4 nights. Something you need to know before booking your stay here is that the hotel is situated about 15-20km off the main road and down a very dark dirt road (we arrived to the hotel in the evening). We had a driver pick us up from the airport in Colombo, but we still felt very eerie once the car went off road. Another reason why this is important is transportation. If you are planning to venture out into Dambulla or visit Sigiriya Rock, then I strongly suggest you arrange transportation before hand. I remember seeing a couple cabs lurking in front of the main entrance, but I'm not sure if they were ordered by visitors or if they were waiting around for a pickup. Either way, have a mode of transportation sorted before venturing out. The hotel site is very interesting and ""eco friendly"". The architecture is definitely one of a kind as the hotel is built in and across the mountain side. Every side of the hotel offers a spectacular view. Considering that the hotel is eco friendly, the hallways and common spaces of the hotel are open air so be prepared to encounter bats, geckos (never seen so many in my life), ants, squirrels, monkeys, and the list goes on. This was all very exciting but at the same time very inconvenient and stressful. I don't mind Mother Nature and everything she offers in the wilderness, but when it comes to my sleeping and resting space, I prefer it be animal and insect free! Every night we found either a gecko or cockroach or a trail of ants or all of them in our room! On the ceiling, on the curtains, by the bedside. In an attempt to be respectful to the culture and the nature of the hotel, I would hyperventilate in the corner while my husband called housekeeping to come and remove the insect. The housekeeping guys were super nice about it and would even chuckle and tell us they're harmless, which we understand but it still made us very very uncomfortable. I would recommend you keep your suitcases closed at all time to avoid anything crawling into it and try to keep your room door closed, even though we noticed the housekeeping keep the room door wide open for over 30 minutes while they cleaned the room! The room was clean but not what I would consider 5 stars. The bathroom had a funky smell and the tub wasn't clean and the bed was not comfortable at all. It was very squeaky and springy.The hotel is lovely to explore on foot, there's so much to see and marvel at. An afternoon at the infinity pool is a must. And as for the monkeys, I guarantee you will see quite a few during your stay, they will definitely come banging on your balcony door so make sure to keep it locked! And as tempting as it is to feed them, they really do become a nuisance and they will gang up on your balcony so be careful with that.All in all it was a memorable experience, I wouldn't go back though. If you're thinking about going with kids, the hotel is super kid friendly!",Negative
"This is a hotel that is full of promise with its stunning, if somewhat isolated, location. Overall though the hotel disappoints. There is an air of complacency about it and also a feeling that the place is set to fleece its customers for as much as it can. The housekeeping standards need to sharpen up; cobwebs in corners are never a good sign! Neither is black mold on the shower blinds and large deposits of limescale on the taps. Generally, the finish quality of the room fabric is tired and showing its age as not much seems to be being done about general maintenance and upkeep.The staff were efficient and helpful. Food and catering standards were generally good. I would therefore rate this hotel only at an good 3 Star level and so fell well short of my expectations.",Negative
"The location overlooking the lake and natural surroundings gives fabulous views. We appreciated the cake and room upgrade extras to make our birthday and anniversary more special. Thank you Heritance Kandalama. Staff also very pleasant. Laundry service efficient. Our room was spacious and had all we needed but the bathrooms are looking a bit worse for wear mainly because of a lot of limescale. The main restaurant serves a good breakfast selection but the evening buffet is not really up to standard and too many people eating in one place makes for a noisy experience. The communal areas lack comfort especially in the bar area. Very few sunbeds means that a relaxing session by the pool is not possible after a busy day sightseeing. A la carte restaurant had much better food and a calm atmosphere but only 20% discount if on HB basis makes it expensive.Would recommend for the view, the unusual architecture and pleasant staff but room for improvement.",Negative
"Stayed 3 nights in February. This is is a large hotel where they take great pride in their ecological aspects. Whilst we enjoyed our stay, the main dining room has a ""canteen"" feel about it which is at odds with the quality of the food which is very high. Rooms are well appointed but are showing their age a little. If we came back to the area we would start by looking for another hotel but overall our stay was on the ""quite satisfactory"" level.",Negative
"Great hotel embedded to the wilderness. Food was good but not the best.Friendly staff., Everyone was friendly and helpful despite the fact we are Sri Lankan Citizens. Especially there was a very friendly person called 'Lalith' helping us at dinner.Food was good, not the best tasting. Lack of seasoning. Had a decent amount of variety 2 buffet and the lunch was set menu.Room was clean, big and modern, but too dark. Some of the lights were burnt out. No accessible plug point to charge phones. Room service was damn expensive. Wifi was weak, specially in rooms. Had a complementary b'day cake which was cool.Overall good friendly people.!",Negative
"Nice location... Nice hotel with greenery...The service was good.How ever, the value for money is not satisfying..Nothing exceptional on room condition/ Swimming pools...Food was great.. Plenty of varieties were there.How ever, pls keep in mind that, the dining hall staff is not allowing male guests to enter the hall with shorts etc for dinner. (ladies are allowed to wear anything)Disappointing on that, since wearing full kits for entire day and had to wear full again for dinner....Overall, average service..",Negative
"We stayed 2 nights in early January and paid £260 a night for a superior room (the smallest size). Given the cost we were therefore expecting something special. On arrival, we were not disappointed at first, the views around the hotel of the nearby Lake Kandalama and lush greenery all around were stunning. We were allocated room 335 which is right at the other end of the property, a 5-7 minute walk from reception. (Apparently this is the longest hotel in the world, a point not lost on us coming back after long, hot days of sightseeing)The room itself was nicely furnished with a natural wooden theme and a perfectly adequate bathroom with a very powerful shower. Though the room was showing signs of wear and tear from mouldy blinds in the bathroom and a rickety AC. Secondly the room was poorly lit with a small budget ceiling light accompanied by bedside lamps. There was also generally poor sound proofing of the rooms from the corridors, exacerbated by the bed being placed on the corridor wall.My biggest grievance though was with the hotel's facilities. On paper, the facilities are wide ranging. There are 3 pools advertised, however only the infinity pool was operational with the 7th floor pool being more like a pond given the number of leaves in it and the reshmee pool closed. The other public areas are devoid of any atmosphere. The ""cafe"" is a few chairs and tables near the infinity pool with a couple of picture adverts dotted around for sandwiches and waffles. The ""bar"" is bereft of life and has these horribly uncomfortable iron chairs and a small bar with a depressing 90s widescreen TV in the corner. The library is not a library rather it is a room with a dining table and a bookshelf. We ended up spending most of our nights in the room for lack of anything to do.We also ended up eating both nights at the buffet restaurant and were grateful for the variation each night. Given the remoteness and lack of food options in Dambulla, you're going to be stuck eating at the hotel and I can see this getting quite wearisome after 2 nights. Saying that though, the options at the buffet were quite wide ranging and the food generally tasty. The buffet breakfast was especially stand out for the number of options and good quality.Overall, we were left disappointed. The hotel has the potential to be so much more given its wonderful natural setting and unique building but it has not moved with the times. A good 5 star today needs to offer inviting public spaces and continuously spruced up rooms especially at £260 a night... 3/5",Negative
"Nice location and great view, lots of greens surrounding the hotel. But the hotel itself is very dated; small rooms (although sizable bathroom), old furniture, and the lighting is way too dim. Lots and lots of mosquitos (I mean it...) in the property as it's surrounded by trees. Fortunately none in our hotel room during the 2 nights stay. But once you're out of the room you can see crazy amount of mosquitos on the walls and ceilings in the hallway all the way until the indoor restaurants. Didn't enjoy the time in the hotel as much because of it - also didn't dare to use swimming pool in case there'd be small mosquitos or bugs in the water. Won't recommend this hotel especially if you hate bugs / mosquitos.",Negative
This property feels like it's modeled on 1980s university halls in England. The exterior is stunning and blends into the environment. However the interior is cold and bare and full of mosquitos. Thousands. The room was less than average and needs serious upgrading. The bathrooms are nice.The restaurants were really disappointing. We were there during peak time and it felt like being in Benidorm. The food is really less than average and terrible for vegeterians or kids.The viewers are fantastic though,Negative
Had heard a lot about this hotel and wanted to check it out for a long.Went with my family and booked the deluxe rooms at a weekend.Nothing was surprising there. Everything was just par. The only disappointing surprise was to have an a la carte menu for a Friday lunch.Total experience was not worthy for the high price you're supposed to pay.,Negative
While the hotel structure is truly iconic in Bawa style there are no other factors to give you a great experience for this destination hotel. The food is very limited in choice and below average and limited/ non existent in-house hotel activities for a hotel that is atleast half an hour away from the nearest town!!,Negative
"I was surprised to learn that the hotel was only just over 20 years old. It felt much older. It is a bold design but doesn't quite work somehow. The area outside our room (at the pool end of the building) reminded me of the inside of a prison. The whole place is a bit tired and it's hard to see how it can be sustained in the long term. It needs a lot of physical upkeep, both the exterior and the grounds. There were lots of staff everywhere so service was good but I felt they could have been better directed to keeping the place clean and making more of an effort with presentation. Windows in our room were dirty, chrome in the bathroom was degraded, the furniture was just so-so. Two plastic chairs and a scuffed table on the balcony aren't really fitting for a supposed 5 star establishment. The air conditioning in the room was exceedingly noisy and the thermostat didn't appear to work. It wasn't the most comfortable of rooms.The main dining room is a lovely spot, especially in the evening but is let down by the quality of the food. There was plenty of choice but it was all a bit bland, especially compared to the Earls Regency, another Aitken & Spence hotel we stayed at.",Negative
"My husband and I stayed here for a night while traveling around Sri Lanka. We appreciated the welcome drinks, but check in took quite a while (over 30 min.) We arrived to our room and appreciated the size and peacefulness. The bathroom was spacious with a large tub, however the tub/shower area looked like it had seen better days. The tub was stained from use over time, the window facing out to the grounds scratched up, and the area around the tub scratched and dull from wear. This didn't really bother us from a cleanliness standpoint, but I did expect more from a 5 star property. We got holistic massages, they were just okay. The therapists were very nice and asked often if we were comfortable. We opted for the couples bath after, which was in a nice big tub, but the drain catch had a bunch of grime in it. We really enjoyed going up to the top floor later before dinner. We checked out the restaurant on the 7th floor and the food did look very nice, but we wanted to try all of the options downstairs. There were plenty of options for dinner and dessert at the buffet, though it felt more like quantity over quality. We appreciated when later that night our power went out in the room (the info booklet does warn about a regular <1 minute power outage at night but we think this was from us plugging something in the wall perhaps) two gentlemen came very quickly to help us resolve the issue. We ordered room service breakfast the next day and it arrived promptly/was tasty. Unfortunately because of the monkeys it wasn't really possible to enjoy our food on the balcony. Over all, this hotel was nice in a lot of ways: beautiful grounds, construction, aesthetic, but seemed to fall short in a few areas for a 5 star hotel. We were very happy to stay at Cinnamon Habarana for a quarter of the price and with a bit more personal/quality service.",Negative
The rooms are dated and a little scruffy. Yes its unique etc but there is little choice in the area.The spa treatment was $220!!!! It was good but had i known it was sooooo expensive i wouldn't have gone ahead. After the relaxation of the treatments the pressure was applied to buy product.. Not appreciated.I gave up on dinner. The buffet was $35 too much.. the bar staff didnt seem to realise i wanted to order so went to bed hungry.,Negative
Hotel is located in nice location .Customer service at the restaurant is not up to the expectation .I shocked when I saw the table lamp in my kids room ( photo is attached ) its very risky as metal/wire is uncovered.I will be staying in heritance Negombo from 15 - 18 Sep. I'm afraid that same service level there.,Negative
"The Bawa's great work, Heritance Kandalam, do you know how did I hear this hotel ? It was at Al Maha resort near Dubai, a staff who worked in this luxury resort is a Sri Lankan. He showed me the pictures that how beautiful Srilanka is. One important picture is this hotel. However, when I arrived at this dream hotel for my favorite architect， a new staff just brought as in the waiting area without any inform. And for the restaurants, we tried 2 times fine dining in the evening, the servers and food both are very nice. However, the last night we tried buffet for dinner, its very noisy, the waiters and even the guys who looks like their supervisors are less smile, not very friendly. The cooking area is much better. However, after this buffet, my stomach pained at least three days.Compared the bad memories for buffet area, the housekeeper team are really impressive. For the decor in the room, the taste is really far away from the great building. I hope the hotel could get some update in future. And for spa, it's terrible. I went twice. However, the first time is ok, even though the towels had some weird smell. The second time, is really made short shrift of the process. More simple and more palter. After the treatment they are so aggressive to sell you products. It's really make me feel uncomfortable.Above all, this hotel is really a middle level of top hotels in this country. I hope it could be improved to match the fantastic outside～",Negative
"We did a trip in Sri Lanka with our two kids (14 and 11) and stayed here for 2 nights when visiting Dambulla and Sigiriya. The view if the hotel is nice, architecture integrated with the nature. We were spoiled by the service in other hotels but here it went wrong. It started already at the start with 3 staff looking around instead of offering the welcome drink. The worst was the restaurant, a big refter where we were offered a table where after 10 minutes we need to ask to clean it from other guests before. They were not organised, it took 30 minutes before tablet where cleaned, so other guest were there without a cleaned table. Food is ok. It was better when we came late. I really had the feeling that there were too many guests for the infrastructure.There are 3 swimming pools but lacking seats. It's not so uncommon that after visiting the cultural highlights the guests want to make a jump. We see options too arrange it different after 5 minutes :-)The pool looked like 2 buss of children were dropped. No real bar, no comfotable chairs, no music, 20 minutes waiting for a cocktail. Rooms were ok, but the bathroom had lot of lime scale.The hotel has potential but nice architecture is not enough to make a great hotel. Funny element, it was the only hotel out of trip, that did not asked for feedback.",Negative
"The Hotel setting and building are gorgeous. The issue is with the whole package. You can't have an iron, for safety reasons, so have to pay for ironing services. The special dinners,, such as going into the organic garden, picking your own veg and having it cooked, costs $500 US per couple. The cave dinner special 'dinning' with a 'lonely flutist' was 2 or 300 US dollars per couple (can't remember the exact figures).Needless to say, we did not go for those options.At the BBQ, I felt very enthusiastic about the variety and theatrical nature of the spread. However, was put off when going for a spare-rib, the chef picked up a raw pork chop and put it on the grill, then helpfully served me a rib using the same tool. The breakfast was great, but tea and coffee serving sporadic and unfocused.I just felt they were a bit desperate to make a quick profit out of the visitors. Had they concentrated on providing an authentic and elegant experience, it would have been better. I think its very big on style, but not enough substance, I am sure you can decide for yourselves.",Negative
We had high expectations of our visit as we had just come from Shangri La Hambantota. We only heard how amazing Kandalama was. Well our expectations were quickly deflated when we arrived. We had been expecting an upgrade to a suite on arrival however were told that it was not possible as all were full. The staff did not handle the situation well at all. And did not even offer anything special given that we had been promised. Rooms are very old and basic they need some serious attention. Also the black plastic chairs on the balcony are not a good look. The staff try to do their best but seem as though the work is an effort. Looks like management do not treat them very well and need to train and manage staff better. This is perhaps a great tourist hotel but for the price we paid we were very disappointed compared to many luxury hotels in Sri Lanka. Many activities mentioned in the hotel are not available which again was another disappointment. It was only worth the visit for the amazing scenery. We would not stay again.,Negative
I'm sure the building is lovely on the outside but on approach you can't see it. The view from our room was spectacular but the room itself was soulless. Walking around felt like visiting a concrete council estate. The staff were nice but rather flat. The place is vast and there was not enough easily accessible information on what was available and where to find it. The buffet food would have been good I think but it was all served tepid.All in all a rather disappointing stay. The surroundings are lovely and I'm sure there are better places to stay.,Negative
I would highly recommend this hotel it's good food the view the pools and everything except the ape attacks. Actually 11th Saturday morning around 7 in the morning I was attacked by an ape and the wound was so major that I had to get stitches and injections if u do hv any small kids pls be aware that the apes attack and bite so risk of that is uncertain but prevention is better than cure. And the day before I was bitten my sister was near the window and the ape has jumped towards it and luckily the window was closed and she wasn't hurt so this is just to avoid another disaster not to bring a bad name for the hotel even tho the staff was very supportive over this matter,Negative
"Hmm. I seem to be in the minority but wanted to share my experience anyway. I don’t think there’s a better option near Dambulla, but I can’t say I enjoyed it. Stay here if that’s what fits your itinerary, but I wouldn’t make it your home base in Sri Lanka. Heritance Kandalama is an eco-hotel, so all the hallways and a few common areas are open to the jungle. I’m sure some people enjoy this (and I would’ve imagined myself in that category before arriving), but I got a little sick of dodging the bats- for reals- and giant moths that were drawn to the corridor lighting. I get it: eco-hotel in the middle of the jungle = lots and lots of insects. Errywhere. With the volume of insect life that was present right outside our door, I felt lucky that we only found one little centipede in our room… thankfully, there was a house gecko in our room who was probably instrumental in keeping the in-room insects to a minimum. On the plus side, there were also several endemic toque macaques on the grounds, which were great to see! Heritance seemed to host a lot of larger tour groups. The hotel offers a welcome drink at check-in, which I would normally be all about, but it felt like we were in some sort of Tourist Check-In Factory; service seemed rushed and like they were trying to hustle us out asap so they could move on to the next group. I’m vegetarian and was totally spoiled for choice.Overall, I guess I’d stay here again if I reeeally had to be near Dambulla, but I’d want to look further afield for a better option if I could.",Negative
"Let me start of by saying this hotel is very expensive as I found all the Heritance chain to be in Sri lanka. Don't expect luxury for the price you pay but what they offer is that quirky unusual unique factor. Our first room came in at an eye watering £220 per night and was a basic panoramic view room. It was very very small and dark with old furniture, cobwebs everywhere and a colony of ants covering the towels and the bathroom in general. It was an extremely loooooong walk from this wing to the main part of the hotel where the restaurant and recreational areas are. We were not happy so we were offered an upgrade the following day. At that kind of rate a night I wasn't very happy at all.The next room type was on a higher floor and with better views and a larger sized bathroom. I think in general the whole ECO theme is great BUT I do feel the hotel and Heritance chain count too much on this too push prices sky high without actually investing money on any refurbishment to the tired property as a whole. The Bad - Very expensive per night and tiny bedrooms, dirty with cobwebs and bugs, Broken old furniture, Very long shaped hotel with loooooong corridors with Bats and Wasps swooping through, although this is a hotel trying to blend seamlessly with nature, it isn't that appealing to have bats swooping around outside your door or at all the light sources, Communal areas are open plan like the Bar and lounges but the seating are uncomfortable metal benches and there is very very minimal use of Air conditioning, again disappointing considering the rates paid. Management would probably attract more people to have a drink at the bar or in the communal areas if they turned the AC and fans on",Negative
"I stayed here with a friend in November 2014 and fell in love with this place. This was the beginning of our amazing tour of beautiful Sri Lanka . It was the first time my husband had been to this beautiful island. Unfortunately, our travel consultant from the holiday place, omitted to inform us that at the time of our tour, it was the Sri Lankan New Year, otherwise I would have booked this tour one week later! We were shown to our room - number 538 which was in the new wing and a fair distance to walk away from the reception area. Along the way to our room, we could hear a lot of noise coming from the pool area in the new wing. Although our room did have a stunning view of the lake, I was noting the dust, the dirty balcony Windows. The bathroom only had a shower and it was very smelly due to the drain in this tiny bathroom. The pillows were dirty and stank of old stale body odours. The noise emanating from the room next door was unbearable. This was not a good first impression for my husband of this hotel and a huge disappointment for me. I went to the reception desk and spoke with Kevin, who apparently was the front desk executive. He told me that the hotel was currently full and as we were there for three nights, if we stayed there that night, he would ensure that our room would be changed the next day. He also said that while we were at dinner, he would arrange to have our room cleaned. This, unfortunately, did not happen and the bathroom stank even more so after we had showered and dressed for dinner. I never saw Kevin again. We spent a very unpleasant, noisy night even though we had been flying and driving for a considerable amount of time.Before we left to begin our tour in the morning, I handed in our room key and told the guy on the reception desk who was privy to my conversation with Kevin, that our suitcases were locked and hoped that by the time we arrived back around 5 or 6ish that evening, they had managed to find us a better room as promised. I had requested a change of hotel to the Heritance upon booking as I had thoroughly enjoyed my visit in 2014. When we returned, we were given the key to room 501. This room had a stunning view of the lake and the Lion Rock, had a lovely clean bathroom with a jacuzzi bath and a separate shower. More importantly, it was a clean room. The food was reasonable and the puddings were wicked!!!! The staff were friendly enough.There is still something special about this hotel. I found watching the wildlife fascinating again but alas I was slightly put off by the noise we experience during our stay. The car park was always full and I am not sure if they allow the locals in to use the outside pool facilities. I love this island and am working on an itinerary for next July/August to see the colourful procession of elephants and locals in Kandy as I want to come back to this pearl in the Indian Ocean and see even more of it's beauty - but I am not sure if I would return to this hotel sadly.",Negative
"This been my third visit to this hotel, the quality of the hotel has been deteriorating from my first visit. To begin with, in my very first visit to this hotel, it was 8 years ago, and we loved the place from the food to the great service and a very good room with a lovely room. But during my last 2 visits which happened to be last year at the same time i.e during the month of April, 2015, the only good thing about the hotel was its service and the quality of the staff. The location, architecture of the hotel is beyond any thing you could experience in Sri Lanka. I would say that the hotel is over priced and has nothing great to offer other than the architecture. The food is not the greatest compared to the other hotels in the vicinity, as the choice was very minimal and limited. This is said as this hotel was known for its food choices and service, and as I mentioned above, it was 8 years ago, and now it has not improved but only deteriorated. Although they did upgrade my room from Deluxe to a luxury suite, its not the suite experience you could expect from Redission or any other Hotel chain. We had to walk a bit to the restaurant despite requesting a room closer to the restaurant. I strongly suggest the hotel does a refurbishment as it lacks one very badly especially the wash rooms which has to be improved drastically. If anyone wants to enjoy the architecture only i would suggest this hotel, apart from that, I think you could other hotels in the vicinity with better quality of service and food and ambiance.",Negative
We arrived after a long and harrowing drive from Colombo (4hrs became 6 due to roadworks) and were walked about 1km to our rooms at the end of the hotel - to be disappointed that we were put down the hall from our kids instead of having interconnecting rooms as requested. I refused to open a suitcase until it was cleared up and we were all relocated to interconnecting rooms.. however the furniture in the rooms was totally impractical and made it almost impossible to open the interconnecting door! The beautifully designed rooms were quite impractical without a comfortable chair to sit on and hardly any decent lighting at all... a black nook for the suitcase meant i had to use the flashlight on my phone to find my clothes! The bathrooms were good and luckily my kids are old enough to shower as there was no bath option for our room type.,Negative
"Our previous experiences at Kandalama few years ago were so good to make us chose to return to this place with our extended families for a nice holiday. Our expectations were quite high, in terms of service, room quality n food. Unfortunately Kandalama didn't deliver it this time around. Service was pretty average which used to be extra ordinary. Earlier the staff had great attitude n service was beyond par. I could feel it from the time i arrive. I noticed my room was quite dusty n needed a vacuum given the fact I have a 2yo in the room. The guy who came to vacuum did made me feel like I'm asking for too much. That's not the kind of attitude Kandalama staff used to have. Room quality: We paid little extra for panoramic view which wasn't worth it. We were far away from all amenities i.e. the reception, restaurant, gym n the infinity pool. The quality of the rooms were not as good as my previous experiences of superior rooms which are cheaper n close to everything in the hotel. Superior rooms are much spacious n treat for eyes compared to panoramic view. Cleanliness of the room was very disappointing. My husband had to kill a cockroach in the middle of the night when my 2yo got up. We found a bug on the bed at the same time. There was dust on the floor. The bathroom wash basin did not look clean : it was stained n disgusting for me. Also the bins. This was a total let down for me cause I didn't feel good at all with an unclean room.Food was really good but not as good as it used to be. The variety of food is limited. Yet I believe, they still served some lovely yummy food. The restaurant staff were friendly as usual.",Negative
"An architectural marvel, beautiful attention to detail and stunning wildlife and views. The Heritance Kandalama is quite legendary for all these amongst the island's locals. However, there are so many things it fails to live up to as a hotel - essentially a place people come to relax and enjoy their holiday. Here are my issues with this hotel: The service is terribly slow - we had a late check in and they took ages sorting out our rooms. We had requested twin rooms which they did not give on the first night, making us move to a twin room the next night.The only real place to get a meal is their large dining area - used both for breakfast and dinner. Dinner is expensive and always a buffet, which we did not want to have on our third (and thankfully final) night.The other dining options are a fine dining restaurant which did not give us our meal after 55 minutes waiting, prompting us to actually leave for the buffet at the dining hall one floor down. Then there's a 'snack bar', a big, empty, unused space, with no atmosphere.Laundry service take two days though we were told it would only take one. As a result they had to rush our order once they realized we were checking out before the laundry could eventually be returned.The hotel promotes itself as Eco-friendly which is great. It's very sincere in its efforts too. But, I believe sometimes this objective came at a cost of common sense. The bathroom accessories like shower gel and shampoo come in ceramic containers, which are not functional inside a shower. Ours tipped over in a slippery grasp, fell to the wet floor of the shower stall and shattered. It wasn't replaced with a new one either.The infinity pool is not clean, no showers to wash before or after, no small footbath to clean feet before or after. So a trample through the muddy stony walkway leading to the pool ensures that same dirt washing off in the pool itself.So, while its quite an experience to stay at this beautiful property, small things like this, which would make it a really superior hotel need fixing. Unless you stay for one night, this hotel doesn't invite nor expect you to stay for more",Negative
"I went here after reading about the architect Geoffrey Bawa and wanting to see one of his buildings. I found the hotel rather a mixed bag in terms of what it offered.It does have an outstanding position with a wonderful view over the lake and it is certainly worth getting a room on a high floor with a lake view, also it is discreet and blends into its jungle surroundings as the architect intended. Apart from this it is getting rather tired and could do with a refurbishment in places. The restaurant is particularly disappointing with a refectory feel and rather too bright lighting. The waiting staff are also rather basically trained and do not offer the service one would expect of a hotel of this standard. The front desk staff are better, especially the guest relations team.When we stayed there was at least one conference taking place which rather spoilt the away from it all jungle ambience. This hotel is expensive, as are the services it offers such as car bookings, and I do not feel that as an overall experience it lives up to what one would expect at this price.",Negative
"We went to Heritance Kandalama only to use the pool,this was a very good tip and the price of 5€ per person is more than reasonable specially because the infinity pool with the view over the Kandaralama Lake is fantastic,you can see many birds and water buffaloes.We drank coffee at the terrace Cafe and could not understand what it is so special about this building,honestly for us looks like one of the public pools buildings of our home town,just a big amount of concrete !! for a good luck nature has covered some of it but still not enough !! we can not say how the rooms look like or if the food is good or not but apart from the wonderful location we did not have the feeling of a luxury hotel.We could see the restaurant from the glass windows and it looked more like a canteen.",Negative
"Although this hotel prides itself as one of the best in the area, and having had a string of accolades some time ago, I feel it is resting on its laurels somewhat.There is nothing distinctly bad, the rooms are fine, good views, hotel layout is interesting. It is more the dated, tired feel of the rooms and access ways that give the impression of something which has had its day. So in short, it needs a bit of a facelift, some life re-injecting into it, to bring it back to the quality and comfort which travelers expect from this sort of accommodation and more importantly, price.",Negative
"Beautiful location. Lovely staff. Large hotel. Bun fight for buffet at meal times. Bath & shower combined in our room, looking out to view. Looked amazing but....Hard to get in to bath before showering. Hurt my leg getting in & out. Food delicious. Not enough sunbeds by pool.",Negative
"The hotel is in the middle of the country, about 30 minutes drive to Sigirya Rock, which is the main attraction, and an hour or more to the other historical sites. (Although it's about 10 minutes to the Dambulla Caves, which are on the must see list, just not my favorite.) You cannot walk anywhere from the property. The hotel was designed by a famous architect, but it's looking pretty dated and not all the exceptional now. The rooms were very dark.",Negative
"We choose this hotel following trip advisor reviews and on the advice of our travel agent. Frankly, we found it tired, lacking in service standards and full to the rafters with large groups of visitors on their grand tour. The a la carte restaurant was ok, the buffet style restaurant was in our opinion unusable because of the cacophony of noise and rude jostling guests. We braved it for breakfast once the hordes had departed. This hotel is only suitable for an overnight stop in our opinion. A low point on our three week tour of the country.",Negative
Unfortunately the hotel is looking a little dated and certainly the quality of the service has dropped. The Sri Lankan food options were a little bit lacking but the fusion restaurant and the spa are worth a visit. The hotel organised a driver for us to Colombo who was terrible. The hotel wasn't what we expected.,Negative
"We stayed here for 3 nights and it was ok. We really enjoyed being able to observe the monkeys. The main pool is nice and had great views, but we didn't spend much time there because of the weather. The room was nice - good size, clean and had most amenities. The bathroom was good too, but a little tired and no wifi. The room was a bit dark though and also very noisy. We could hear everyone going down the corridor and also people drinking in the bar, which was about 10 metres away. We actually had to complain twice about the noise from the bar, due to a large group that were shouting (we had put up with this until after 11pm). The food was generally very good and the service was good too, but the experience wasn't very relaxing and all quite rushed. The hotel is somewhat lacking in food and drink amenities. Considering it is a large hotel, there were only 2 restaurants, one cafe and a small bar in the corridor. There were a lot of lounges though, but with no facilities, which we found strange. It would have been nice to sit outside and enjoy the view and drink in the evenings, but this wasn't possible. The hotel overall was somewhat dark and in my opinion, oppressive. The service, aside from one member of the bar staff and a couple of waiters, was generally not good. This was the only place we stayed in Sri Lanka where the staff weren't friendly and helpful - mostly surly and unsmiling.Overall, this hotel has a lot going for it, but also a lot of areas that could be improved. I would still recommend staying here as it's worth a visit for the setting and architecture, but I think just one night is enough!",Negative
"Upgraded from a deluxe with lake view to a suite with 'jungle' view, wrong move, tried to get our booked choice & not available; if going here you need a view of the lake to look at Eagles. Buffet was the worst on all of our trip around this island, greasy, greasy & poor choice. Limited excursions, so glad we had our own car. Understand the appeal, the monkeys, the lake, the Eagles, but the jungle is winning, as the concrete is crumbling and the ants are taking over. Booked for 3 nights, checked out after 2 & went to Kandy - good move....",Negative
"I find this review difficult to write because this hotel is a bit Jekyll and Hyde - some good points, some pretty bad points.  The good: true jungle location, with superb views over Kandalama lake, sea eagles circling overhead, monkeys and mongooses running around - loved it. Unfortunately most of the best views are only from the communal areas; the bedrooms are in two wings off to each side so few have such good vistas. That said, they're spacious and well appointed, comfy beds.The bad points then: breakfast aside, the hotel doesn't have great dining options. In the evening the main restaurant does a buffet which was packed and felt like a cruise liner - awful. No views either after dark. There's a small a la carte restaurant upstairs which is pleasant if a bit formal - and that's it. No cafe, no bar menu. We ate in our room twice - room service quality was excellent - and just went down to the bar for drinks. The bar area is ok but as others have pointed out, also acts as the reception for arriving guests so it's again lacking atmosphere. The few tables out front by the pool are nicest. The pool areas are ok - we used the infinity pool for the views (beware, it's unheated). But it's small so gets pretty crowded and it's hard to catch anyone's eye from the bar above to order drinks. Niggles, yes, but this place is claiming to be 5 star. We tried the spa and felt it was overpriced - rooms were basic and quality fine but nothing special.If you're really keen to stay here, I would suggest arriving after lunch and just spending one or max two nights, maybe on your way to Sigiriya or Kandy. On balance, I'm glad we went but wouldn't return to the hotel as it is.",Negative
"Amazing views from this hotel. We were upgraded but were told this was because they oversold the room type we booked. What a missed opportunity just to tell us we were being offered a complimentary upgrade rather than an accidental overbooking. Nonetheless , we were of course very happy with our panoramic room. Nice size , nice views, big bathroom. Food is buffet only as in many larger Sri Lankan hotels. Breakfast was good but we found the dinner buffet , while offering a huge variety, missed the mark. We tried a bit of everything but in most cases did not find dinner enjoyable including the curries which were a hit almost everywhere else we ate in the country. Good location to explore the area by car but don't expect to walk anywhere. Most staff were friendly however I had to argue (and lost) with staff insisting on grabbing my bag to walk it the 20 meters to the car when checking out then he appeared upset when I opted not to tip for his aggressiveness.",Negative
"There is nothing intrinsically wrong with this hotel if you like large hotels 1 km long. The views are fabulous , over the lake if you are in a room high enough and the large number of monkeys are amusing to watch. You do have to be careful as I turned my back for a second while the patio was open and a monkey took a n unopened bag of crisps took them onto the balcony and shared them with a few more. The room was fine of good size and the bathroom had the advantage of a large window. The hotel has been designed so your privacy is ensured. Breakfast was a buffet in a large room, the quality was fine. We chose to eat in the a la carte restaurant on an evening as this had good service . The wine by the glass was barely drinkable. The bar area and other sitting areas were just too big and did not encourage an after dinner drink. The hotel is well used by tours of tourists resulting in a lot of early morning and late evening noise as people and their bags went too and from their rooms. I did not have an unpleasant time at all but would not choose to return.",Negative
An amazing hotel set in the rocks above a beautiful lake. It must have been amazing when it was first constructed but just felt like it needed a bit of attention.The food was good but not amazing and the dining room and bars lacked ambience and character.,Negative
"The hotel is in a stunning location and has great potential. The bad points are as follows: 1.The interior is very tired and needs renovation, rooms have mildew, stains in the toilets and damp pillows.2. The food options are very poor. The buffet was expensive but adequate, and was very different from Thursday to Friday. Much better on Friday but still same cost. The snacks bar was awful, overpriced poor quality food.3. The service was indifferent at best and poor at worst. On arrival the staff gave no information at all about hotel and activities and did not even smile. Our bags got lost by porter and took 40 minutes to arrive.4. The excursions offered by the hotel were twice the price we found from a local taxi firm.Overall we were disappointed. The manager tried to appease our complaints but we were still not happy.We would not recommend and would not return.",Negative
"Booked this for the last two nights of our Sri Lanka trip, expecting a luxurious end to our holiday. We left after the first night (losing a large chunk of money) when we realised it's definitely not luxurious nor special. On the positive side it's a stunning location; the lobby/pool area and first glance of the lake it overlooks is breath-taking. Also the staff are consistently friendly and keen to help. On the downside, it's very tired and the rooms are not what you'd expect for the cost. This was the most expensive hotel we'd booked out of four in Sri Lanka, and the room was the poorest; dark, narrow room (we'd booked the panoramic), leaking/rusty bathroom and generally all feels cheap and old (a pair of flimsy plastic chairs feel really out of the place considering the view from the balcony). Also the architecture is stunning in places (lobby, infinity pool) but largely it feels like you're walking around a long carpark - too many long and dark walkways and corporate sign-posting. Maybe this hotel just wasn't for us - if you like buffets, an international menu and big hotels in general there's a lot to appreciate. But for us it's massively over-priced and aside from the view does little to celebrate Sri Lanka or make guests feel special.",Negative
"This is a beautiful building set in the cliff designed by Geoffrey Bawa. And there it sits on the its laurels. It purports to be five star - and certainly charges so - but comes across as only four star partially because of the transitory feel of the guests - and partially because of that the hotel lacks attention to some parts of its facilities. The room was lovely - once we got the twin we booked - with a stunning view and creepers on the balcony - and a rainshower looking like you are showering in the forest. But the sanitary ware especially the loo was not up to standard and was dirty and pitted (see pic). There were no robes in the room though we noticed other guests had them. The rooms also need spraying for insects. Though the infinity pool is beautiful the area surrounding it is scrubby and inadequate (9 beds for 370 guests) and there was a very manky small pool (not sure what for) that was manky and insect ridden (see pic). They have a very captive audience for food and rely on that - there are 3 places to eat - a snack bar on the terrace where the choice is limited and expensive and not very special- it also doubles as the place where guests wait for their rooms. There is a ""fine dining"" restaurant which is rather dark and the choices not as advertised on their website but better than the ubiquitious, crowded - and very expensive - buffet on the floor below. Our advice - get out to eat if you can - it's much better and cheaper. The bar only had two tables - and made no attempt at atmosphere. With people only staying one or two nights - there is a distinct lack of effort - needs some work to justify its upmarket tag - though it is stunningly placed",Negative
"Expectations were very high based on reviews . Location is fabulous overlooking the lake. But the accommodation needs a big overhaul including the road up to the hotel. I've noticed a lot more negative reviews since the New Year and I have to agree with most of what has been said. Snack bar food was dearer than the mains on the A La Carte menu which makes no sense. Our shower leaked all over the floor, pillows were very hard, towels very thin and no reading lights or bathrobes. Seriously lacking luxury but well able to overcharge, I am baffled by how this hotel is a five star. On the positive side the buffet breakfast was quite good and the infinity pool is notable and the food in the A la Carte restaurant was tasty although a little cold at times. I felt our stay was too long here and we only stayed for three nights. I would not recommend this hotel to my friends",Negative
"Everyone says you simply must stay at this unique hotel, in a remote jungle setting overlooking a lake with the famous Sigiriya in the far distance. There are certain drawback s however, which are not major but should be stated.We have paid more for a room with a panoramic view, but it takes considerable imagination and a bit of ducking and weaving to actually see said view, which in our case is from level 5,over the lake. Hardly worth rating a mention in my opinion.Then there was the check in. Despite arriving at 4pm, our room wasn't ready. No apology, just a request for our patience. Ok, were fine with that, but how about a drink from the bar to compensate? Now the room.It is showing its age, particularly the bathroom with a sorry looking vanity and quite unattractive silicone work visible between tiles and glass shower walks.Next the pillows. They need replacing with something that has a little 'give' in them - these are as hard as Sigiriya. hopefully the new ones wont have the smell of damp. Also no one thought out the conundrum of returning to a dark room and trying to find where to put your room key in order to turn the lights on. Thank heavens for the iPhone torch.On to the positives, if you take half board here- and you should consider doing so as this location is very isolated, the buffet is plentiful and looks delicious.Yes, there is plenty of wildlife, cheeky monkeys will swing by your balcony and the sounds of the forest coming to life at daybreak are like living in a David Attenborough documentary- just filter out the noise of the air conditioning systems below.",Negative
"This place is well passed its hayday and is now just very overpriced and underwhelming. The scenery and surrounding landscape is gorgeous, but the food, accommodation and general hotel amenities leaves alot to be desired. My room had a shower that flooded the bathroom, musty smelling room and very little light (where I had to use a torch to see in my suitcase after sunset! ).The food is very average and oh so expensive...dare I say it, this place is a bit of a tourist trap.",Negative
"What an amazing setting for a hotel! Built into a ridge on a rock face, the hotel is designed very much in tune with nature. You don't notice the hotel till you drive right up to it. The hotel is located in Sri Lanka's ""Cultural Triangle"" and overlooks an ancient man made reservoir (Kandalama tank) and the splendid 1500 year old Sigiriya rock fortress. Don't miss out on climbing Sigiriya. The ancient Dambulla rock temple nearby is also well worth a visit and a much easier climb than Sigiriya.The property is a masterpiece created by the renown Sri Lankan architect Geoffrey Bawa. Typical of Bawa's genius is the corridor you walk through when you enter the hotel is designed funnel natural breezes through the lobby. Of the 3 swimming pools, the main infinity pool with its vistas over Kandalama tank and the pool built on the rock face are also signature Bawa touches. Kandalama hotel was built in the 1990's and I have visited it many times. Sadly, now the entire hotel (and especially the rooms) need refurbishment. Hopefully the owners decide to do justice to Bawa's creation by giving the hotel the update it deserves. I wont be returning until they have done so!One more thing: They have free WiFi but you need to enter an 11 digit (yes eleven digit) user name each time you log in. Each user name is hand written on a card and connects one device. How long do the staff take each day to write out all these user names by hand? This is the worst way to connect to WiFi that I have seen in any hotel. Given the hotel's remote location, the only people connecting to WiFi would be hotel guests and staff. So do you need to be make things so complicated for both you and your guests?",Negative
"First, Geoffrey Bawa's hotel design is spectacular in the way it blends with nature. The view from my bath was amazing with monkeys walking by and looking at me. The views of the lake and mountains are beautiful. Now the downsides. Overall some of the public spaces seem faded. The food is very overpriced by Sri Lanka standards. The same applies to the tour desk.",Negative
"This was my second visit after maybe over 10-15 years which I had no memory of. But I was expecting great 5 star hotel which many people have described it as.The average/In between: The interior of the hotel looks old. Maybe due to the gloomy/dark weather or the infestation of the millions of insects on walls (No overexerting there). I guess one can turn a blind eye to it because its all part of nature and this hotel is located in the middle of a very green environment. And they are harmless, so unless you have a fear of insects you have nothing to worry about.The furniture looks like it's been there since the hotel opened, interior was poorly lit, the glass windows not cleaned well and a dark elevator which feels like taking a ride on a time machine. Long story short, the hotel looks like it hasn't been taken care of very well with a long due refurbishment job.The food felt very repetitive, specially the desserts. Nothing extra ordinary, just average taste.The bad:First time at a hotel/resort I was asked to wait outside the restaurant because there were no tables to offer during dinner service. Multiple parties were waiting outside in frustration without being able to get a table. One night my group of 4 were outside for over 20 minutes. If this was a separate restaurant I could understand, but I cannot comprehend how a well established hotel can't provide tables for guests when it's busy. That's assuming the hotel is at max capacity and everyone showed up at dinner service at once. This single handedly ruined my experience because this happened on both the nights I stayed. Even when there were larger groups of tables vacant the staff didn't remove them and set up smaller spaces for the people waiting outside.Opinion Overall:I think the famous Kandalama has lost it's magic. The website photos look fantastic but in reality its a farcry. Most hotels out there are well maintained and look beautiful on the inside or out, or even both. Everyone who has been to Kandalama says good things. But to me it looked like the hotel is slacking off. A diamond in the rough that needs some polishing. Will I return? Most probably not anytime soon. I had high hopes for Kandalama but it didn't quite live up to the hype. And with far too many hotel options available these days I rather experiment with a new venue than revisit a hotel that didn't quite live up to my expectations.",Negative
The hotel has a great view. It's located in a forest and you can see the monkeys jumping from /to your balcony-it brought happiness to the place.But the staff wasn't that welcoming(as it was in all other places in Sri Lanka).The buffet was satisfacory (only the things the prepare on the place were tasty).But the thing that upset us the most was that in our second day there was a heavy rain that brought lots of insects and reptiles to the hotel (outside the rooms but inside the restaurants and bars). You expect from a prestige hotel like the heritance to be capable to deal with such a problem.,Negative
"he hotel has a interesting architecture and is nicely placed within the nature.However, this isn't sufficient on that high price level. First, the rooms need a bit of maintenance and better cleansing. Second, if you like wrestling with Chinese traveller groups for an poor ""international"" buffet you have fun. Otherwise, you have to search for the few delicious dishes eg the desserts. Third, we had to switch in 4 nights twice the room. Once because of a broken bed and second for the AC maintenance of a entire wing of the building. The management of the moves was rather chaotic and we sat many hours on packed luggage just to wait for broken promises on move schedule.Last, the hotel take little advantage of the amazing surrounding. We had great guided hiking tours, walks on the lake shore or jungle, but the security tried to keep us within the hotel with false alert on wild jungle elephants.So, if you want to get good value for your money, look for a hotel with a good management and a concept beyond ""famous architecture"".",Negative
"It has been just a week since we got married and me and my wife were here to spend a little bit of honeymoon. So we had booked a Deluxe room. When I entered the room I realised that although deluxe room higher in category, Ithere was no much difference compared to other rooms except for the Jacuzzi. The service and food was not that great but it isn't bad either. This place is overrated because the people rate based on the natural surroundings. The hotel wins thanks to the nature and nothing really greater about the hotel alone.Make sure you book the elephant or horse ride as soon as you get there otherwise the slots will be full. We were on the honeymoon package and was supposed to receive complimentary canopies which we never received. When I complained about this when I checked out, the guy at the counter did not care...I asked for the famous ""hot butter cuttle fish"" at the restaurant and we received something that tasted like dry fish. We had to return the dish and they did not charge us for that cause I believe they knew it wasn't what we requested.From what it appeared, the hotel has a limited number of rooms with a greater view. Good to visit once if you are curious and that's it. Won't visit again.",Negative
"This was the most disappointing of our stays in Sri Lanka, but it was ok. The Geoffrey Bawa design is very interesting and beautifully integrates with the natural surroundings, but that doesn't translate to the most intuitive functional design - ideally you'd be able to do both! Overall it was ok, in isolation most aspects of the hotel were just fine, but it felt like a massive hotel and we were a bit spoiled by some amazing boutique hotels and smaller resorts. It's a great location for access to Dambulla (highly recommend the Buddhist caves there!!) and Sigiriya (also a must do, do early in the morning). Hotel spaces: The lobby is a bit weird and gets chaotic when there are large groups checking in. Mixed service at the bar there. The pools are ok - the main one is very cool with great views but not many places to sit and gets crowded as it's quite small. The bigger pool is at the far end of the hotel and somehow seems a bit forgotten. Room: The room was fine - nice but nothing fancy. Shower with glass wall facing out to the jungle with monkeys leaping by was cool. ",Negative
"This is an iconic SL hotel, designed by the great Bawa. Location and amenities (including re-designed Spa and gym) second to none. There were some surprising niggles, on this our last visit, though. My mother had difficulty walking the long distance to her room, and although a vague promise was made, she was not moved to a more proximal room. At check out the deposit she had made was not credited to our account, even though one of the numerous (unidentified) cashiers did acknowledge that a cheque had been received in her name! Sadly, no one senior came to sort this out, and the only option was for us to settle our bill in full. Interestingly, a senior manager did come to sort out an error in the bill of a foreign customer before us (we are Sri Lankans), but, hey, perhaps I am being too sensitive! We left our contact details, but no call has been received with an update (almost 24 hours later). It was delightful being back after many years, but we did feel that the experience was soured by rather lacklustre and inexperienced front-of-house staff. (Believe it or not, as we rushed off to Colombo, one of the cashiers was on the 'phone to the company's head office, trying to see if the deposit had been credited to their balance sheet!)",Negative
"This hotel used to be fantastic some years ago. So we expected great things when paying approx $200 a night. Hotel was very tired with lime scale stains in the toilets, bad odour because of it, very scanty bed linen, no bathrobes or slippers etc which are usually standard for a 5 star hotel. There was even a cockroach in our bed!Buffet was so average that it was like a cafeteria. Beef was overcooked, black forest cake dry,etc. But the overall package is just not worth the price! Especially with so many other hotels and villas to choose from.",Negative
"This hotel is set in a beautiful location, overlooking a man made lake. The views and wildlife that we saw was fantastic. We were upgraded to a deluxe suite for our stay (it was our honeymoon). The room was spacious, bed very comfortable. (Pillow menu included :). Bathroom had a shower as well as a Jacuzzi which was a great addition. Good selection of toiletries. We sat out on our balcony most nights which was really relaxing.Cons were Nothing nearby, hotel is located down a long dirt track.Wouldn't stay longer than 2 days it is very isolated and very expensive for food and drinks.Bathroom blinds need upgrade as were mouldy and falling apart. The buffet is average and VERY expensive, there are no nearby eating options.We ended up eating in the café the last two days. The menu options here were very limited though.(probably to encourage guests to use the extortionate buffet upstairs) One staff member in the Kanchana Café was very rude, kept asking my husband if he wanted another beer and when my husband didn't want one, he rolled his eyes and walked away abruptly. This happened twice.",Negative
"We chose Heritance Kandalama back in July 2013 as a base to visit Sigiriya Rock, Minneriya National Park and the ancient city of Polonnaruwa.We stayed for 2 nights on half-board in a Deluxe Room in the Sigiriya Wing. The highlight of our room was the amazing view over expansive landscape. Equipped with a Jacuzzi bath with overhead rainshower, the bathroom offered a stunning view over Kandalama Lake and abundant green vegetation. However, getting into the bath took some maneuvering and would pose trouble for the elderly. The same expansive landscape leading right up to Sigiriya Rock could be enjoyed from the bedroom and balcony. Although the interior décor was still pleasing, the furniture was already a bit worn-out and the level of cleanliness required improvement. We did heed the warning about keeping all doors closed and locked as the cheeky monkeys paid frequent visits. The Kanchana Restaurant offered sufficient choices at breakfast and dinner but nothing to write home about. As hordes of tourists used the restaurant, it is worthwhile to queue up early to secure a table with a nice view for dinner. Be prepared also for frequent power outages in both the restaurant and hotel rooms. We found Heritance Kandalama to be much less enjoyable during night time. While it was evident that the architect Geoffrey Bawa did a highly commendable job blending the building into the natural environment, once into evening time, the open air corridors attracted far too many insects that translated into a severe letdown of the overall ambiance of the hotel.Heritance Kandalama could have deserved a 4-star rating. However, we found the level of service to be sadly inconsistent, ranging from a most gracious lady receptionist at check-in who showed us our room to some ill-bred mongrel during check-out who was dismayed that we had already pre-paid our bills.",Negative
"The rooms in this hotel are tired and are in need of modernisation. Our first room had stains in the toilets and on the curtains so we asked to move to another room. The new room's air conditioning broke down at 2.30am so we were forced to contact maintenance and this was resolved within an hour but obviously disrupted sleep. We were assured that this would be investigated the following day to prevent a recurrence, however it broke down again the following afternoon. The management offered to put us in the suite to ensure it wouldn't break down again in the middle of the night but it was obviously very inconvenient. Furthermore, the cold water didn't work in our room and we were forced to contact maintenance for this as well.The food in the hotel also needs modernising - huge buffets of food are no longer fashionable - a few menu options would be much better. We ate in the a la carte restaurant on one night, the rice and curry had come from the buffet downstairs and was not made fresh. We opted to eat in the poolside bar for the remainder of our stay to avoid returning to this. ",Negative
"Our first stay at Kandalama was not too long after the hotel first opened and it was truly unforgettable. We were blown away by the architecture and interiors, the stunning location, the fabulous hospitality and amazing food. It was with high expectations and great enthusiasm that we decided to go back in April 2015 wondering why it had taken us so long to return. Upon arrival, check in was quick and we were shown to our rooms. Unfortunately the remnants of the previous occupants was still evident in the rooms (food strewn about, hair in the bathroom!). We asked for the rooms to be cleaned again, which was done promptly. We also found that the mini bar had not been re-stocked after the previous occupant. It was a good thing we checked and informed them as otherwise we might have ended up having to pay a hefty mini bar bill! The rooms are in dire need of renovation. The bathrooms in particular could do with new fixtures, the taps were scratched and toilet seats broken. There was a leak from the shower area which caused water to puddle near the sink which was extremely dangerous. We asked for the leak to be fixed and were informed that the problem could not be fixed immediately and needed extensive repairs. We wondered why that room was given to guests at all, as they seemed aware of the issue.We thought the food was tasty, plentiful and quite diverse. However, not really the same standard of food we remembered from 20 years ago, which was some of the best hotel food in Sri Lanka we've experienced to this day.The service for the most part was average. The best service we received was from the restaurant staff at dinner who were very friendly and helpful. One minor issue we had was when we asked a waiter if we could get some tea with our breakfast, we saw this waiter tell another waiter, who then told another waiter. We watched this unfold and eventually flagged down a different waiter who brought us tea very promptly, though at this point it was almost 30 minutes after our initial request. Having had such high expectations and such wonderful memories from our previous stay, we were rather disappointed after our stay at Kandalama. We were told the hotel would be undergoing renovations next year, and we only hope that Kandalama will be brought back to the impeccable standard it was once renown for.",Negative
"We stayed here for 3 days. Our suite was really big and had a very nice jacuzzi bath. Itt was great seeing the monkeys on the little balconies outside and again by the swimming pool. There were about 30 of them eating the vegetation - really great to watch them. The hotel is well located for trips to Sigirya, Polonnaruwa and an elephant safari.Other than these points I was disappointed with this hotel.The buffet room was huge, noisy and just like a massive canteen, the al a carte literally empty, there's no conditioner in the room and the toiletries are in ceramic bottles. I dropped the lid of one whilst in the shower and cut my foot - I can never understand why hotels use ceramics for toiletries, the wifi is a nightmare, you get given a code and every time you change location so go form room to buffet it drops off and you have to re-log in and then the code deosnt work and you have to get another one....The sockets don't work at night so be aware of that if needing to charge your camera etc. I'm unsure what time they are turned off, there are very few sun loungers so if like we did you have a few spare hours good luck getting one......the bar is just a part of the lobby and no one goes there, there's no where to sit outside - you have the pools with too few loungers, then there's the cafe under cover but open at the sides, the lifeless bar and that's it which is a pity as above the cafe there's a kind of large deck where they could easily place some tables and chairs, service in the cafe for a drink is slow and even slower if you are by the pool,I'm unsure why they don't. Any how it's not a bad hotel, but nothing special apart from the monkeys.",Negative
"My family of 5 adults stayed at Kandalama on 11-14 March. This was my second visit to Kandalama having stayed 4 years prior. I was really looking forward to it however it did not live up to my expectations. When we first arrived we were disappointed to see that my parents and brother who were sharing a room were put in a ridiculously small room that at check in did not have a bed for my brother. We complained to the travel agent and directly and did have both our rooms changed the following day which resulted in a significantly better room for my parents and brother. Geoffrey Bawa designed an excellent building, however Aitken and Spence are not doing adequate maintenance. I saw evidence of wood rot, wood fungus and tile delamination as well as the need for painting, plus more. Due to the construction being built into the jungle constant maintenance is required and this is not being done. This is such a shame.I visited the day spa and this has not faired well over the 4 year period and is in desperate need of work. We dined one night in the Kaludiya al a carte restaurant and I really enjoyed my meal. As I am not a big eater it was not much more expensive than the buffet and much quieter.The desk lamp blew the switch apart when I turned it on and this also tripped the fuse for our room plus others. Unfortunately this also seems to have damaged my husbands Samsung tablet which was using the same power point and this is in the process of being assessed for repairs.Would I stay here again? No unless I had evidence that the maintenance issues have been addressed.",Negative
All kinds of insects will be seen in this hotel after 7 pm. ............ Don't go out of your room also many occasional electrical shut down. .... Not recommended to stay with children however very friendly staff,Negative
"This hotel came recommended for its location and it is wonderful, nestled into the rock with great views, and is a Sri Lankan design icon. We were disappointed to find the infinity pool was half cordoned off with no explanation. We were advised it was not safe to walk in the grounds but could join one of the hotel's walks at cost. The shop was very over-priced. We did not make it to the a la carte restaurant - there was a lack of clear information in the room and it was not explained to us upon arrival. We ended up in the 'buffet' by mistake and whilst there was no complaint about the quality, quantity and variety of the food, the service made up feel like commodities rather than guests, we felt hassled to finish and move out. The hotel was full of large coach parties and it felt like a posh Butlin's in that respect - just too large and lacked the personal touch that we found everywhere else in Sri Lanka.",Negative
"As other reviewers have noted this hotel is in a stunning location overlooking Kandalama Lake, with great vistas from the public rooms and many of the bedrooms. The hotel covers a vast area and sometimes the distances between bedroom and lift/stairs to restaurant and between restaurant and washroom are also quite long. Great architect Geoffrey Bawa, but missed out on the details like this and why is such a single, tiny lift to the main dining room? The bedrooms are lovely and spacious with a glass-walled shower that makes it seem as though you're in the garden (fortunately you can't be overlooked). The infinity poll on the 5th floor was wonderful and the adjacent cafe was great for lunchtime snacks.Downside was the big, noisy dining room (not good on acoustic levels, Mr Bawa) which catered primarily for big noisy groups, so the ambience was more canteen than restaurant. Best to eat late after they had all finished, although by then some of the food was running out. Food was buffet style both in the evening and at breakfast, and service there was patchy, unlike our (3rd floor) bedroom service which was excellent. On the last night we ate in the 5th floor cafe.The other disappointment was the lack of information about the facilities on offer, especially nature walks in the grounds. The promised brochures were not in our room and enquiries at reception did not meet any helpful response. A great shame as this had been one of the main attractions of the hotel for us.",Negative
"Huge hotel n very nature, limited restaurant, pricy food with average taste especially in coffee shop but great view. Slow wifi, uncomfortable bad n blanket.",Negative
"We stayed 3 nights and agree that the location is excellent. With a little attention, this hotel COULD be 5 stars and showcase itself as a marvel of architecture and design. The problem is that the modernity has gotten lost amidst cutesy decorations and overgrown vegetation. I love the landscape, but some simple trimming would allow a view and help keep the windows clean. The clean, spare, modern design needs an update. The rooms are a bit musty, damp, and dark. The bathrooms are old (what's with the black curtain by the bath covering a filthy window?), the linens tired. The pools are well-designed but still need some care. The one real bar is lost in the chaos of people arriving and departing (as well as weddings and other events in the lobby). The food is great, true, but this hotel was a disappointment. The Heritance Tea Factory hotel in Nuwara Eliya is much better in every category!",Negative
hotel is quite old and not well maintained. Had leaking problems in the bathroom. Also car was damaged while parking. the damage is done to the windscreen. No proper security there.,Negative
"The building was very unique, built into the rock face with a gorgeous, scenic view. Very luxurious, comfortable room. One of the best breakfasts we had in Sri Lanka. Unfortunately, my good review ends here. Check in took ages. We were exhausted from a long day of travel and after a 6 hour journey from the airport we would have appreciated a speedy checkin. Instead they left us sat in the bar area for almost 30 minutes while we waited for our room keys.More importantly, I was disappointed to hear about the treatment of driver. Our guide and driver, after much prompting, revealed that he dreads staying at Heritance Kandalama. He said that the food fed to the drivers is often leftovers or even once he was fed bad fish that had gone off so they went without dinner that night. For breakfast, the drivers are fed only dal and bread. As a customer of this 5 star hotel I would expect much better treatment of our driver. Management seriously needs to address this as I would not stay in a Heritance establishment again after hearing this. I don't expect him to get luxurious treatment or anything but fresh, substantial meals at the very least!Additional note: we arrived home to find we were charged twice by the hotel on our credit card. They are currently refunding it but it's quite annoying that something like this could happen. Double check your credit card statements if you stay here!",Negative
"This hotel is well located and excellently equipped. (As an aside why do hotels seem to prefer to put the loo roll holder where you can’t actually reach it, oh and why supply shampoo in a ceramic container, you guessed…wet hands…). They cook good quality meals for the breakfast and dinner buffets even if the costs are hard to find until you sign your bill, 3200 rupees (inc service & taxes for dinner). The wifi is free and generally reliable…..OK, so you can guess there are some “buts” coming…One I don’t really blame them up for is the buffet dinner which had an extensive range but the customers keep laving the Bain Marie lids open so if you are unlucky it's only tepid at times. Onto my main gripes, which might sound minor but they have really put an edge on my stay. The staff are too many, they fall over each other (often it should be admitted in a charming effort to help) but the bottom line is that the delivery of any request is ludicrously extended when it even happens at all. Yesterday I ordered 2 large bottles of water from room service, 24 hours later I still haven’t got them. We used the laundry service, well so far we have put clothing in, but not got it back. My wife asked reception how the system worked and she was invited to go back to the room and they would send someone. 90 minutes later we handed it to the room service man who seemed surprised and was trying to give us towels…so it looks like that not a good move. We rang housekeeping 24 hours later, “no problem “ and that without even asking our room number, amazing. But still no laundry, we leave in the morning and this is really getting to me. 2 hours after asking Reception to sort it we got it back at 8pm but we are leaving tomorrow so it was really uncalled for worry.One last gripe, the staff in the dining room are attentive to the point of being deeply annoying – when I bring a sweet back the table from the buffet I don’t expect hands literally (and I mean precisely that) dashing under my nose to move the spoon and fork from the top of the plate to the side...even as I was reaching for them. I can open a car door myself, I can put my own napkin on my lap and pull my own chair in, here all these are done for you but that means overmanning so that I have to weave around the staff to get to the buffet, the all time record is a knot of 8 of them in the dining room. I accept this is one version of service provision possibly perfect for some people but frankly I just get irritated, if I pay this much I expect to stay at my convenience and not theirs.If you like being grovelled to this place may be for you, however if you, like us, expect a hotel to simply book you in, give you a comfortable bed and feed you to a good standard, all done expeditiously and unobtrusively, then this one is perhaps not for you.",Negative
"A little surprised by the sheer size and what seems at first by the potential out of place architecture of this hotel in a most wonderful location in the middle of nowhere. The room was a little tired, but very quiet, only disturbed by the noises of the surrounding jungle and the odd monkey on the balcony - especially the one who brought her baby to show us!! The swimming pools - all 3 are a little disappointing - given the hotel's wonderful location - not much sitting area and very tired loungers and faded towels. The buffet was very average and we didn't try the a la carte as there was no one else eating there. Full of tourist groups on tours of Sri Lanka on package tours not our normal cup of tea, but nonetheless we had an enjoyable stay.",Negative
"Stunningly designed hotel cut into the rockface and it looks awesome as you approach it. However as soon as we got in, we were led to a waiting area where a hostess looked after us, and then completely disappeared. She never reappeared and it took about 40 minutes before we were finally showed to our room, which after a 6 hour drive from the airport and an early morning to catch the flight was highly inefficient and very irritating. We would have loved a swim, but it was too dark by the time we were finally in a position to be able to. Room service was equally terrible. It took at least 30 minutes for someone to turn up without what we had asked for, and they disappeared never to be seen again. I went into the corridor to see if I could find anyone, and a girl was there having been locked out of her room who had been waiting a significant amount of time to be let in, and was still waiting! I paid extra for a panoramic room to see the lake, but it wasn't worth it as by the time we finally got into it, it was dark so no view and we left early to go to Sigiriya the next day and got back too late to see it the next night as well. So don't bother. The balcony wasn't worth sitting on as it attracts the monkeys and recommendations are to keep the door locked otherwise they will come in and ransack it. The bathroom desperately needed updating. These days most people don't have time for a bath, and the shower was a miserable hand held halfway up the wall useful only for a midget. As soon as you used the shower after you took it off the wall, the nasty plastic shower curtains either stuck to you, or if you put them outside the bath, flooded the bathroom. Food was a buffet so there was lots of choice for all tastes, and some was really good. House wine was awful.If I were coming here again, I would stay somewhere else. Since most people here visit Sigiriya, then I would find a hotel closer to Sigiriya. But we travelled with Aitken Spence,and this hotel belongs to them, which is why they pushed this one as being the best around. Not true.HELPFUL TIP There's also an elephant ride available a couple of minutes from the reception. It was sold as being an hour on the elephant riding around the lake, but in fact all it did was go up and down the drive (too wet to do anything else apparently), so don't bother with that either unless it really does go around the lake.",Negative
"This hotel is set into the rock face and is surround by wildlife and forests, the setting is truly awesome, however it is very much let down by what goes on inside.It seems very much like 'service station' with the staff seemingly bored that people are staying there. (this was the only hotel in Sri Lanka like this). The bar area is VERY unfriendly with incredible uncomfortable furniture, its almost like they have designed it so you won't sit there and the outside space for sitting is also very small indeed. The room was ok and the bathroom was novel, in that the shower had full length windows so you could see out of and the Monkeys could see in! We have stayed in much better accommodation and this place could do with a bit of a refit.Food was pretty ok, but again the staff really lacked anything about them which was a shame.This place could really be something quite wonderful, but it really does need a staffing change and a bit of 'life' in the hotel itself.",Negative
"We stayed at this hotel for one night as part of our honeymoon.As we pulled into the hotel, we were wowed at the location, and the surrounding wildlife (the hotel is built into the rock, has surrounding jungle and a view of the lake below). Service was professional, if a little soulless. At other hotels we've stayed at in Sri Lanka, the staff have been lovely, willing to have a chat with you and bending over backwards to may your stay memorable - here, they were merely businesslike.We had a deluxe room, and again, the view was fantastic but the room itself seemed a bit worn and dated. There was limescale creeping up round some of the taps, and the furniture was passable. When we went to sleep, the bed was uncomfortable, and we could hear much noise from the corridor. Both myself and my wife awoke after a fitful night's sleep with back and neck pain.Wifi was also poor. The dinner was unremarkable with the food being bland and uninspiring.What annoyed me most were the charges levied on all drinks purchases - government tax, VAT and a service charge. Other hotels in Sri Lanka don't do this - there is no reason for Heritance Kandalama to do such a thing.All in all, for the money that one is paying, there is a lot that Heritance Kandalama can do to improve.",Negative
"Whilst the architecture and overall hotel is stunning, we were quite disappointed with the standards of the room, much lower than you would expect for a 5-Star hotel.Our first room smelled terribly musty, so we asked to change and were moved to one that smelled like cold tobacco. The rooms are quite dark and the lighting is really dim. The shower and sink were leaking badly; and there were quite a number of bugs.The road to the hotel is in bad shape, with many potholes, which takes 20mn instead of 5 to reach...",Negative
"The hotel is nice but it is not 5 star and it is not value for money. The pools and setting are lovely and rooms are pleasant. The wifi keeps dropping out though one does not come to Sri Lanka for wifi. The food is very over priced and one can not have Sri Lankan food except at the buffet and the western food offered is not good quality, I would have preferred to eat Sri Lankan food.",Negative
"The good stuff ---Architecture and design of hotel and rooms are impressive, food is good and staff are warm and friendly. Bad stuff --- we got one of the panoramic rooms and while the room is lovely, the room isn't clean, shower drainage doesn't work properly, and outside our room you can see a lot of things that are undergoing repair. We asked for bathrobes and they came --clean but very tatty. I wouldn't even expect these kind of bathrobes on a 3 star hotel, let alone the supposed calibre of this hotel. Insects on walls in most places, staff while friendly and willing to help are mostly inefficient, sad to say. Hotel facilities are strange.....1 restaurant offers only buffet. If you want a la carte, you go to a fancy looking restaurant where no one dines. There is no proper bar as the so called bar opens into a corridor that is open to kids, babies etc. no comfortable chairs to relax in at the cafe nor the bar. Strange. And why can't the hotel spend on fixing the roads to their hotel? Also, I was told that the guests' drivers accommodation are horrible. Beds ridden with mosquitoes and insects. I think drivers deserve better treatment than that. All in all, I would say that the hotel is very average and considering we paid over gbp200/night for the room, I think the hotel failed to deliver on our expectations, specially after experiencing a recent stay at another Heritance hotel --- tea factory.",Negative
"the hotel itself is pretty stunning! Loved the architecture, the infinity pool & the overall cleanliness + the staff in general were very friendly. Fantastic location overlooking a beautiful lake & it's not too far from Dambulla. We left feeling a little annoyed though as the hotel charges an exorbitant amount for some of the services that they provide. We needed a driver for two days to take us around the Cultural Triangle & thought that we would consult the hotel on pricing etc. Note: you can't get a Tuk Tuk due to the distance. Basically he quoted $160 more than the local taxi company for the two days which was a 100% mark up considering the hotel driver was not a guide & the cars are pretty much the same as it was a standard car. So if you don't have a car, call the local taxi company who were amazing DO NOT use the hotels drivers. If you are planning on dining, make sure you eat at the buffet (which is very good) as the a la carte restaurant is very depressing, the food is average at best & is overpriced.",Negative
"We enjoyed our stay at the hotel, particularly appreciating that it was spacious, clean and the staff were welcoming.It may just be that we were there out of season, but the place felt deserted, with huge voids of space, a really unwelcoming bar area at the ground floor, and rather ordinary food which could have been so much better. Fair to say that the hotel is seeking quantity over quality so far as the food is concerned. A little hesitant between 3 and 4 stars, but just feel it falls short of the 4.",Negative
The front desk staff were excellent and it is a very large hotel. Certain aspects are looking a little tired and need renovation. Looking at monkeys on your balcony when you wake is a strange sensation ! The top floor restaurant is good but the buffet area is a disappointment - vast array of selection but quality was ordinary - restaurant staff seemed unable to understand any English except for order taking. A strange smell in the Buffet ?,Negative
"The Heritance Kandalama is well located to explore the Cultural Triangle of Sri Lanka including Anuradhapura, Sigiriya and Polonnaruwa. We stayed there for four nights and with our driver managed to see all three. The setting is arguably the best feature of the Kandalama with the hotel cleverly built into a rock face and with many rooms having stunning views overlooking a plain, lake and the Sigiriya rock fortress. It was spending to wake up in the morning looking out to Sigiriya while seeing elephants roam the plain and drink water from the lake below while monkeys scurried around foraging amid the tree tops.. The views from our room included Sigiriya and we were delighted to have monkey visitors every morning come to our balcony who ate up all the dead bugs and moths which had accumulated over night.Unfortunately, beyond the actual architecture and setting, generally we found the Heritance Kandalama in need of updating. The room in particular, despite it being an upgraded Deluxe Room, was not ‘luxury’ or ‘5-star’ as advertised on the website. I would classify it as closer to 4-star, but even then I would say it was showing its wear and tear and in need of a renovation. The lighting in the room in particular was insufficient and it felt very dark and gloomy in the evenings. The light bulbs were very low wattage and there were too few of them. The bed too was hard and unimpressive. The facilities are fairly standard with two small/medium-sized pools. As there weren’t too many restaurants in the area, we used the hotel’s buffet restaurant for breakfast and dinner and it was pretty good considering how isolated the location was.Service was ok, but did not stand out relative to the standard and price of the hotel. There was an incident where we tried to order tea at the restaurant during dinner and the waiter quite literally refused to bring any, saying that if we wanted hot tea we had to go out and have it at the bar. Perhaps there was a language miscommunication problem, but after about 5 minutes of discussion I asked to talk to the manager who did bring us tea. Regardless of what the problem was with bringing us hot tea at dinner at the restaurant (they had no problems bringing any other drinks: soft drinks, beer, wine), the fact that this happened at all did not reflect well on the customer-service orientation of the staff.The rooms are very much in need of a refresh and service did not go above and beyond.",Negative
"The hotel is perhaps, rightly proud of its eco credentials and was built 20 years ago by a renowned architect. It also looks much better from the outside than in. However, the interior lacks any warmth, soul or personality. It is a collection of concrete spaces; a uniform dull white colour with dark floors and occasional wood ceilings etc; there is no colour; no local art; no pictures of the beautiful countryside etc... The bar - apart from the 4 bar stools must be the most unfriendly, uninspiring bar I have ever been in; the main dining room is factory canteen like and the al la carte one uninteresting and cold. I have owned and lived in several ultra modern properties - this one needs some updating; some interior design and a rethink. The rooms (we had a deluxe) are fine with great views but the decor again is dark and unfriendly; there is no ornamentation at all; the deep sunken jacuzzi bath/shower is dangerous (difficult to get in and out of) and impractical. The balcony is nice but with millions of insects and no fly screens and monkeys, they are not really useable. Food was OK - just - but is real factory operation designed for coach parties etc....This cannot be the best hotel in the area. It is definitely not the best I stayed in in my 6 weeks in Sri Lanka...I understand that a refit is to start next year. Avoid until completed!!!",Negative
"It's a nice place with a jungle feel, although they are renovating at the moment so if u like the sound of a grinder at 7 pm or morning u will enjoy it more. The food is quite expensive compared to the last place we stayed at. It's a nice experience would be better once reno's are finished. The rooms are nice and the bathroom needs a bit of a touch up. The shower looks really dirty, and the bath smells like bleach. ",Negative
Not happy with chained elephants in the grounds including distressed baby rocking side to side whilst her mother carried tourist around the grounds. Just wrong!,Negative
"Travelling as a couple, we have mixed feelings about this hotel, with its gorgeous views overlooking the lake and mountains (you can see Sigiriya from the terrace) and stunning architecture. Just driving up to it, on a narrow road through the jungle, gave us the sense that we'd soon be in a quiet tropical paradise. But this was not to be. But here's why we're conflicted: yes, the architecture and jungle setting is gorgeous but this hotel is ENORMOUS, and because of that, it can accommodate many tour groups and business functions. We were not there during the high season, yet the buffet breakfasts and dinners were packed. There is an a la carte dining room that we couldn't get into one night, at least at a decent hour, and when we did eat there on the second attempt, we were very disappointed to find only one Sri Lankan option on the menu.Thinking we might have a quiet drink in the lounge overlooking the infinity pool after climbing the 1200 steps of Sangiriya, we were rudely disappointed. While not crowded, a family group in the corner were totally oblivious to the screaming and running around of their three young children as they hurtled through the lounge and the nearby corridors. The staff did nothing to intervene. Also, some tour groups are really loud - they speak at high volume whether at a table for two or twenty, and thus the quiet promise of the jungle surroundings is not possible at all, except in one's room. (And not even there if those children decide to run up and down YOUR corridor - which they did!) There is no prohibition against smoking in the common areas; be prepared to inhale as your neighbours light up one after another. The staff was always pleasant, although busy. The infinity pool is beautiful but with very inadequate lighting after sunset, and the path from the hotel to the lounge is completely dark, making it very easy to trip on the rough stones.",Negative
"The hotel trades a lot on its Bawa designed pedigree, but while the outside looks impressive, the rooms are far from flash. Our twin share room was not even remotely functional or comfortable. It was also a very long way from reception and the restaurants. After a long day out, the last thing you feel like doing is a 1km + roundtrip just to get some ordinary food.",Negative
The service was a bit below par though. The rooms are nice and the Food was also great in my opinion but they need to do something to get their service upto an international level. The staff barely spoke English for example so it was very hard when we were ordering food to make requests as they just did not understand what we were telling them.,Negative
"When planning our trip we were really looking forward to our visit to the Heritance hotel. After great other hotels in Sri Lanka, Heritance Kandalama turned out to be a disappointment. Our main comment is that the hotel is ok, but highly overpriced.Pros of the hotel: beautiful view, spacious rooms and the design and architecture of the hotel are truly special. Waking up with monkeys on the balcony is definitely amazing. But as said, that comes with a price.Cons: the hotel is big and therefore misses authenticity and atmosphere. The staff is friendly, but far less hospitable then the rest of Sri Lanka. Breakfast buffet is big, but not very tasteful. Dinner buffet was overpriced, not tasty and typical buffet, not our taste. The a la carte restaurant was a better choice, but not very atmospheric. Infinity pool is nice, but surroundings are not feeling very clean: sandy and not well kept.Bathroom is nicely designed, but should be better maintained. There are stings everywhere, there was a leak in the room and the overall feeling wasn't very clean. Furniture looks old, and the room in total is not very atmospheric too.To conclude: the place is special because of the architecture and view. But there are other hotels in the same area, from which I expect you can enjoy better value for the price paid.",Negative
"The design of the hotel is spectacular and we love how the hotel seamlessly integrates into the surrounding nature. Watching the sunset over the lake at the hotel's infinity pool is indeed a unique experience. Having said that, the service is really average considering the price of the room. Room amenities were lacking, shower and shampoo were half filled, when we checked in, and when we asked the reception to send more bathroom amenities it was delivered after more than an hour and that is after we reminded them. Overall value is poor but the architecture is a saving grace.",Negative
"Me and my husband stayed at the hotel for one night it late July this year.It was little difficult to find the way through all the sandy roads to the hotel during the dusk and it should need better indicators of hotel location.However the staff welcomed us warmly and i appreciate their hospitality.The rooms were clean but not very spacey with all the furniture..But once we opened the doors to the balcony,there was a rush of bees into the room lights and it was very uncomfortable. ",Negative
"We stayed here for 5 nights and generally the hotel is quite nice but it is getting a bit tired. It is supposed to be a 4 to 5 star hotel and it has priced itself in that region which makes it a little expense for the experience. The dining options are limited as there is either a buffet of an a la cart restaurant with an uninspired a la cart menu.There are 2 other dining options of eating in a cave for a novel experience or chef to cook in your room. These options were astronomically expensive, IE US$200/head for an average looking menu and half a bottle of wine.",Negative
"Service: Friendly and fair. But this is a hotspot for local tourists, office crews and various organisations for weekend/day travel. This place can get really crowded especially the main lobby and the pool and very noisy which was the case during our 2 day stay. Architecture: This is more of a nature hotel. You will find it blends with the surrounding forest and sometimes bats fly across the corridors making it a creepy experience. Expect mosquitos/monkeys or other insects or small animals in the hotel premises. Weather: Avoid north-east monsoon season. Cleanliness: I have visited this place before. I feel that after taking over by new management under the Heritance Group, this hotel is being neglected and maintenance is very poor. It used to be a lovely, well maintained beautiful place which I could recommend as a business hotel. Now it’s nothing but a nature hotel with forest growing in to the hotel with poor maintenance.",Negative
"After great reviews from our tour operator we stayed here for 3 days in July 2014. Starting with the positives we had a warm welcome on arrival and our room was amazing. We were in the Sigiriya wing and had a great views of Sigiriya Rock. We had all sorts of wildlife visit our balcony including monkeys and bats and the room itself was clean and had everything we needed.However, although you were in the jungle and you got to enjoy some wild wildlife this hotel very much caters for the package tourist. They had a few 'wild' animals in pens, with the fences well disguised so they looked like they were there out of choice. Instead they just looked miserable. The hotel also offered a range of optional tours - including an elephant ride along the lake. This very much put a downer on the trip. Conservation and sustainability seems to be high on the agenda in this hotel and in Sri Lanka in general but to be in swimming in the pool and see the ill-treated elephants carry over weight tourists spoilt the experience. The food offered was disappointing compared to everywhere else in Sri Lanka and it was expensive. As mentioned above the hotel very much caters for the tourist and therefore the food was much more westernised and there were very limited opportunities to try local cuisine. We went for the buffet on our first night but, as a vegetarian the options were limited. So on the following night we went for the al e carte which ended up being the same price as the buffet but the food was freshly cooked, delicious and the environment was much nicer.",Negative
"Firstly to get to this place you have to be prepared to undertake a road journey of about four hours ..... if you have a weak heart be prepared as the driving is just downright idiotic and dangerous. Even if you have a good careful driver you can be smashed to pieces by a bus or lorry coming straight at you whilst overtaking on a blind bend - Sri Lanka you need to sort this out ! The service on the whole is good but can be a little patchy accompanied by the ""blank face"".If you want peace and quiet dont go to this place. Dining options are limited to buffet style only - whilst the food is perfectly ok it would be nice to be able to have a quiet dinner. The ""Dinner in the cave"" at US$350 for two is seriously poor value for money - the location is fabulous and the service great but the food is not what one would expect at this price - tinned peaches served with the starter ! errrrrrr i think not. Be warned there are quite frequent power cuts - a little tricky when one is on the treadmill as I learned form personal experience......Would I go back ? frankly its not worth the effort to get there.",Negative
"I was sold by the photo featured in Silver Kris - a resort wrapped in lush greenery seemingly appearing out of the mist. Alas I was to be sorely disappointed. Don't get me wrong, this resort is deserving of its repute but unfortunately we didn't get to fully experience the place as it is perhaps meant to be - a chance to reconnect with nature. The place seems very popular with families with young children who were running amok and yelling at the top of their voices at the public places most of the time. Not my idea of a relaxing holiday at all but that's just me. If you do not mind squalling kids, this is perhaps a really good place as it has three beautiful pools, great scenery and a chance to get up close with the monkeys, squirrels, birds and butterflies.We also took a ""Dinner in a Cave"" package which at USD350 for two, is decent but forgettable.Given that we flew 3.5hrs and then took a 4hrs arduous car ride from the airport to get to this place, I would have not have bothered if I had the advantage of hindsight.",Negative
"This hotel is in a great location around the water and is in proximity to the main sites of the area. On the negative the service was average as were the rooms. We found the rooms to be small (suprising given its location, the servicing of the rooms was lacking, they didnt replenish the bathroom or tea/coffee facilities even after reminding housekeeping. Even sitting around the iffinity pool the we found that it took ages for our drinks to come. (TIP dont order the coffee its awful) When we tried to organise transport through the hotel to see the Buddah caves in Dambulla the first guy @ reception quoted a price that sounded OK but when we saw another guy the next morning he quoted a rate nearly half. Not sure how this happenned but when we challenged the first guy as we were leaving he found a quick excuse to leave reception on some errand. (tip do your homework)",Negative
"I visited this hotel as a part of a pre-booked tour (haven't selected myself). Based on the hotel's website it was supposed to be supporting eco-tourism since it's in the middle of a natural/national park - what a joke! The hotel is in a middle of nowhere which means you have no options to go elsewhere to eat - the prices are high and selection not that good, especially if you want something light and small. The breakfast selection is fine. The hotel itself is huge and from concrete. It was probably 300 m from our room to the reception. You can already see the negative impact on environment and how the grounding isn't solid; during rainy season water hits the building and can't escape -> cracks and moisture pillars could be seen. You can't justify three pools when there is not enough drinking water for locals. In addition, there were plants which didn't suit the climate & environment. The room itself were very poorly planned for several reasons. 1) the AC was directly towards bed and very loud & couldn't be used with small volume, i.e. you either had it hot or you froze. 2) The place the put luggage (we obviously had two) didn't have any lamp -> how can you sort out your stuff? 3) No racks, etc. to put up your stuff. 4) The room for two persons had only one chair. BTW, mattress is quite hard. Hotel might be designed by a famous architect but I consider it to be without any positive atmosphere and it's an eco-disastor.",Negative
"This hotel is good but not great, certainly not at a five star standard, the room was ok good views the bathroom toilet seat we cleaned ourselves as it had not been done.Normally i would have called housekeeping but it was easier to use an antiseptic wipe . The hotel has great spaces but it lacks atmosphere and is in need of refurbishment .",Negative
"We have been planning to visit the hotel for a while because of the ratings and location. When we visited it was not what we expected. Cons: The rooms are showing age. The room amenities, furniture are showing age. This hotel is long, very long. Depending on the room it can take 2-4 minutes to get to the buffet.The bedding is too stiff specially around the border. My 1 year old had to share a bed with wife because the middle is just impossible to sleep on. Lovers be warned. There is no children's pool. The rock pool on top which should have been a main attraction looks like abandoned. The pool amenities such as changing rooms can be better . The staff are not as friendly and seems distance specially during the buffet. Overall it was a bit of a let down for me. This hotel is long, very long. Depending on the room it can take 2-4 minutes to get to the buffet so plan well if you are not into walking long distances.We got a room in the 2nd floor on the Dambulla wing, it was too small for me and had only a shower and a tube TV, I was able to change the room to the Sigiriya wing same floor but there is no view at all so please try to get a room on 3rd floor or above if planning on the Sigiriya wing.",Negative
"Our first impression went down the drain being a honeymooner expecting a wonderful surprise for me & my wife in the room. There was nothing done even a basic honeymoon setup calling the hotel reservations team for many times. They just informed me ""everything is ok sir"". Giving nice hopes and talking big things about Heritance Kandalama with my wife on our way was a nightmare when I reached my room. Though everything was coming perfect afterwards as like our room upgrade and so on, nothing made up our mind sets happy with the things happen in the arrival. I choose this hotel for my honeymoon and Unfortunately it was not at this time. ",Negative
"Since I am a great admirer of the architect Geoffrey Bawa, I was very much looking forward to spending two nights in his masterpiece hotel. Upon arrival you are welcomed with a hot towel and a drink, nice. But hey, the hotel claims to be a premier 5 star hotel! To make sure to get a nice room, even though it was low season, I booked a panoramic view room in the Dambulla wing. The room was nice and stylish, but not at all five stars, stained curtains and upholstery, leaking shower, floor and carpet not so clean... Ok, it's not easy to maintain such a hotel under these climate conditions. Unfortunately there was some wedding or convention going on just the floor above my room, they were playing loud and bass driven music. You simply couldn't sit and read on your 'private balcony'. When I came back from breakfast the next morning (9 a.m.) the music started again. I was very frustrated and complained. They upgraded me to a luxury room down in the basement without any view. Alas, no view at all.. In the late afternoon I ordered some tea at the poolside cafe, they served one (!) cup, of course charged like a premier 5 star hotel. Sorry folks, I am not a cocktail & BLT sandwich person. I like to have a decent cup of tea in the afternoon, i.e. a pot of tea, usually served with a little biscuit. I know that single travelers except from business hotels are not always most welcome. But in a five star hotel they shouldn't give you the impression that your place is at the side table... All in all very mixed feelings about Kandalama hotel. The hotel is an unique work of art, breathtaking. But still, there is a sour taste. Maybe I just had my sour days...",Negative
"Rooms seems to be bit congested. Probably you need to re think of arrangements of furniture. Need proper guidance for guests who comes for the 1st time to find the room. If you are directed to wrong wing, you will end up spending half of the day to find the room.Since the hotel is islocated, please re-think of out door activities available for house guests. Room service need to be bit more improved interms of speed.",Negative
the rooms was clean but had a tired look to it..I guess a refurbishment is in order..,Negative
"Amazing location as always. stunning property built into the rock.Sadly, the place was renowned for its amazing buffets and the reason we booked and paid a premium to stay there was this very reason. Its worth going here just for a different experience. but sadly the food was very poor. only the sri lankan food was available for lunch along with two options off the menu. This is definitely not what was expected. Dinner was not that much more exciting either.Sadly as amazing as the place is I regretted booking the place due to the buffet being sub-standed .",Negative
"The heritance kandalama is amongst the mos beautiful hotels I have ever stayed in. Unfortunately a few things left a bad taste, the international buffet was very ordinary and very expensive whilst the other restaurant had delicious food but was in a disappointing location (a windowless room that really lacked atmosphere). But by far the most disappointing thing was the fact that we felt a little detained, the hotel staff would refuse to organise any transport out, other than the highly overpriced hotel car fleet. Given the hotels remote location this proved a real inconvenience and just left a slightly bitter feeling.",Negative
"Visited kandalama hotel after a decade since our last visit. We are on our way to East and stayed one night there. The charm and the elegance of Kandalama is still there. Only missing thing for me was the oriental music group and two singers who used to sing during the evening.Dinner was a disaster for us, probably due to the fact that we stayed during a week day. That was no where close to the standards Heritance hotel has set for themselves. Almost all food items were prepared using various sauces so we jokingly deduced that the theme for the night was Sauce Night. Desperately I tried some local dishes however that again was not that good. The action station did not serve any red meat too..",Negative
"The property is sprawling - it's organized into the Sigiriya Wing and the Dambulla Wing. We had a room on the 3rd floor of the Dambulla Wing and it was a hike to get to the public areas. So if you have mobility issues, make sure you ask for a room near the central part of the hotel. The dining facilities were a bit lacking. The ""fancy"" restaurant was tucked away an internal room with no windows or view. The main restaurant felt like a feeding factory with bad acoustics (very loud). The best place we enjoyed was the terrace restaurant near the main pool, however it was often understaffed and service was friendly but slow/inattentive. The room was a bit dated with old TV, and bathroom was not well maintained (shower leaked everywhere and water stain on all chrome fixtures). The pillows were super bulky and hard, even the feather pillows we requested off the menu were really hard. Blankets were old and wool, way too hot for Sri Lanka.",Negative
"average service, very large and busy buffet restaurant, no cosy residence bar, subpar wine list, rooms can be a bit noisy, be ready to walk a lot if you are not in the main wing.",Negative
"Only some rooms are good. ONLY stay in Sigiriya Wing on levels 4 and above. Floors 2 and 3 are dark and miss the views. I would avoid the Dambulla Wing, it appears a lot less maintained.Very ordinary food in both restaurants, coupled with annoying set meal times. They open for dinner at 7.30pm. I often wanted to eat earlier and the room service menu is limited with awful food. Regular Buffet only options which is not for everyone.BIG tour groups make the hotel overcrowded. It was impossible to find some quiet. Poor use of open plan common areas, with bad lighting and empty spaces with little purpose.There are 3 swimming pools, but only the main infinity pool was clean.In-Room Dining was dreadful. Basically stale sandwiches and french fries with everything. Almost inedible. Service was adequate but quite aloof.All in all, a shame to see such an icon of Sri Lankan modern architecture not get the basics of hotel operation right. It is chaotic to stay her. I suggest you come here, admire the wonderful design, maybe have a drink on the terrace for the view (if you can get a spot amongst the tour groups) and then go stay somewhere else. Also, be prepared for flying insects at night and bats flying through the corridors - interesting!",Negative
"What is the great about Geoffery Bawa's architecture in particular? Buildings made of concrete that creates the charme of a parking garage with huge hallways? Maybe only Sri Lankan people can understand that, I don't! Balconys are nice to have however you can neither see anything due to plants nor can use them due to monkeys that will grab everything they can reach or even attack you. the hotel has three pools, one is unspecial and takes you about 20-30 minutes walking there just to find a small rectangle pool with a spiritless water ball net.. Ehm...? The other is 'nature based'... Nice but the water temp is so unpleasant at 21 degrees that you don't spend much time in it. The third one is in fact the only nice one with unpleasant cold water as well. the mentioned distances are ridiculous. Just walking from your room to the reception is easily 10 minutes one way...rooms are worn and habe definitly seen better times. To sum up: The Kandalama might have once been a true 5 star hotel but is definitley not anymore. Thus, the hype about it as vastly exaggerated. I would say it is something in between 3* and 4*. Given this, the hotel is much overpriced. Compare it to the Mahaweli Reach near Kandy and you see a definitley better cost return ratio. Don't get me wrong, I am complaining on a high level. But that us what the Kandalama wants to be. A high level 5* hotel. It is definitley not to international standards. In other reviews I read comparisons to the Overlook hotel feeling in Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"" and to evil James Bond villain hide-aways. Both is somehow true! Go there, pay 200 USD and more per night and judge yourself... But do yourself a favour and do not book for more than one or two nights and if you really, really, really (and I mean REALLY) like it, extend your stay on the fly...",Negative
This is a good hotel but we had to pay to use the pool table. When you pay the price that you paid for this hotel you'd think that you would be allowed to use the pool table for free. Also the pool table is in a seriously useless spot in the family dining area. This closes early so you can't use it after around 9.30pm. The pool table should be in the bar area where people can actually use it and enjoy it. This is a good hotel but there are things that can be improved. The games room is also rubbish. The gym also closes early. The drink prices at this hotel are the most expensive encountered in Sri Lanka. ,Negative
"I would have to rate this hotel as 3.5 stars at best and considering this would have to say it's overpriced.Hotel staff are poor and as others have pointed out are disinterested and very inexperienced. There are always around 10 to 12 staff in reception who are running around and always appear to be busy even when they are not servicing customers. An amazing sight!The rooms are not particularly clean, are poorly maintained and are badly in need of an upgrade. The TV's in the rooms are tube TV's which belong in a museum.The food in the al la carte restaurant was poor, bland, and unimaginative.I have to agree with others that the Christmas decorations were tasteless and hideous detracting from the experience of the natural setting of the building - Santa and his sleigh blocking one of the rock walls was a sight to behold!Nice location but a pity about the hotel! Bawa would be disappointed!",Negative
"So much of the beauty seems superficial - like the decorative young women stationed in the reception area, who ask if they can help you, and then don't understand what you're asking for because their English is not up to snuff. Every time this happened,i had to work my way up the food chain to a manager who actually spoke English. The very overpriced Christmas eve buffet was visually gorgeous; however, the food did not match the visual promise. We ate in the upstairs dining room the second night o escape the crowds, and the food was regrettableGoing to and from the spa requires walking through the entire reception area, usually in a robe - really not well thought out. The people working the reception desk were not fully knowledgeable about the offerings. Our room was so so- we arrived late due to a long drive, and must have gotten the last rooms; the view was of the parking lot. The amenities were sparse- no facecloths, no toothbrush etc - just a bar of soap and hair products that smelled like a fruit salad and no robes no slippers. All of these appeared on the second day. Probably the worst challenge was the lighting - it was the equivalent of candle light. The closet had a shelf for your suitcase yet there was no light above it so impossible to find what you needed.The nearest light was on the bedside table so no help there.the setting is exquisite, the architecture stunning, the experience did not live up to expectations.",Negative
"We stayed for 3 nights and other than the above mentioned points there was nothing at this place that stood out. It is a large hotel and that may be the reason I felt like just another traveller being pushed through their system. Although the housekeeping staff was exceptional nothing else really stood out at the Heritance Kandalama. Perhaps because of its outstanding location and design I expected more; whatever the reason, it wasn't a particularly memorable stay.",Negative
"Heritance Kandalama is just a breathtakingly beautiful hotel and an architectural masterpiece but sadly the service levels are way below the standard which is expected from a hotel of this magnitude.This was our 2nd visit to this hotel and we were upgraded to a suite on the Sigiriya wing . However even though the jacuzzi was not working it was promptly fixed on informing housekeeping. A rope has been used to demarcate the shallow end from the deep end which means you have to literally pull it over your head to swim across the pool which is ridiculous in a 5 star hotel !While we were at the pool we spotted several pool attendants throwing stones at the monkeys and were very disturbed given that the hotel use protecting nature as a selling point !We were very disappointed with the level of service in general (the only exception being house keeping) and the food at the main restaurant. On our arrival we informed the guest relations executive that we were vegetarian and no attempt was made to even find out whether the food was satisfactory. We had very little choice and which was ridiculous considering the fact that this is a 5 star hotel and the FB rate is very pricey . On the day of departure we wanted to change the booking from half board to full board so we could have lunch and they quoted an exorbitant rate so we ended up having lunch on the way back to Colombo. Subsequently we left some of our belongings at the hotel and while we appreciate the fact that they were extremely helpful in locating our belongings and sending it to Colombo, it was at our expense. Since the cost is negligible , this really should have been done at the expense of Heritance to make an unhappy customer happy.",Negative
"We just stayed for one night on the way to Sigiriya. I liked the place, but it has some weird edges and service was not always as you would expect from a hotel in this price range.Unfortunately the window of our room was covered with plants from the outside, so the view was limited.The receptionist that took care of us was always friendly, graded us up to a better room and did her job very well. Unfortunately I can not say the same of all the staff. As we were traveling as backpackers we arrived with a TukTuk. Maybe that is not a common sight at this place, but I would assume that hotels such as this should be able to deal with the unexpected. The porter however just looked at us, making no effort to help my girl friend with her luggage. He only started moving to help me with mine, that I was dragging out of the vehicle, after our driver had asked him to do so. We left the luggage with him and went with the receptionist who handled the booking. When we arrived to our room, our luggage had unfortunately not arrived (even though it was 20 minutes later). Had to call the reception first. Similar thing in the afternoon when I asked for an adapter for the power outlet. Reception promised they would send someone. Nobody ever came. Asked again a few hours later at the reception in person. Same promise, never delivered. Called again in the evening, stressing that I was a bit annoyed. Finally it appeared. Same thing happened when we checked out. We asked, if somebody could bring our bags down, while we settled the bill. 15 minutes later, still nothing appeared. Only after I asked again, they were brought down quickly.Same in the restaurant on the patio. Waiter was nice enough, but getting his attention was not always easy, as he seemed distracted by the magician who was performing. Btw. this magician: I do not get the concept --> we went to the patio that has a nice view to have a sundowner and a relaxed evening. Suddenly the magic guy pops up his shop, sets up a CD player on high volume that had speakers that were clearly overused by too much high volume usage and starts a magic show. To be fair, there were a lot of people watching and I assume it was great for the kids - but not really compatible with a nice relaxed evening. Uh and while the rooms and most of the hotel is quite classy, the entrance area looks a bit like Dr. No's lair, built in the 70ies, complete with an gigantic snake statue that makes you think you are in Disneyland.Last point of critique: the food. I went to the indoor restaurant. The place looks nice. There was a private party next door, so the music blasted through the doors. But no big deal. Service in the restaurant was nice and efficient. However the food was not up to standards they charge for. Meet was slightly overcooked and too salty - the portion however was quite big. The menu is designed to make you think you are in a high class restaurant with fancy food creations. However in the end what is served is pretty much standard, and that in a quite low quality. Worst was the apple cake I had. Only ate a few bites, not sure I saw a single piece of apple in it. Service and the kitchen need some serious training. The place needs to decide, what exactly the target group is. I would advise putting the magician somewhere where kids can enjoy, but people who do not want to, do not have to. And please get rid of that ridiculous snake!",Negative
"Very imposing hotel in the jungle, noted as an architectural marvel, but getting anywhere in the facility requires very long walks. At night, huge numbers of insects congregate around lights in the open corridors so getting into your room without half of the jungle life requires fast work. We were upgraded to a huge suite on the 7th floor with panoramic lake views. But, we were wowed by the lake through dirty windows in a room with worn, ill designed and poorly organized furnishings. The breakfasts and dinner buffets offer good food presented by a fairly lethargic serving staff. Restaurant prices are much higher than the norm, but, I suppose, that is to be expected in a hotel so far from everything.",Negative
"Most of the ""wow"" factor in this hotel is in the nature around it and in star architect Geoffrey Bawa's architecture. The rooms higher up are wonderful, tastefully furnished, with great views. Clean, but fittings a bit outdated (try turning out the light while in bed!). Unfortunately, there is little ""wow"" in the way it is run. You will certainly get lost, as the signage is either absent or inaccurate. The information in the folder in your room will leave you none the wiser. Most confusing of all is the food situation. Bear in mind that you are in the middle of nowhere, and there is nowhere else to eat. Good luck finding out what the restaurants serve, because the menus are not displayed at the entrances. I will say that the buffets (breakfast and curry lunch/dinner) were excellent, but the a la carte choices were overambitious and often bizarre (strange fusion food in one restaurant, strange snacks in another - think burger bun filled with grilled chicken and served with french fries). There are many missed opportunities (simpler, less pretentious and less expensive food, less extortionate spa treatments, and above all better guest information - the customers would spend more if they knew what was available and where - on my last day, before an early morning departure, I discovered the shops were open, even though none had their business hours displayed). This hotel has so much going for it. It's a shame it's underexploited. With more attention to detail it would be an excellent place to stay.",Negative
"The room was damn and dusty mostly, with odour. Peace is constantly disturbed by balcony doors slamming by cleaners/guests every day throughout. Soup ordered from room service came uncovered and cold! 'Clean' towels were stained. Those 'great' reviews are so overrated.",Negative
Large hotel which is over hyped as to its Eco credentials. It may have undergrowth enveloping the balconies but that also makes the rooms pretty dark! The infinity pool is nice but small for a hotel of this size. The shower room was well in need of a refurbishment. Great location for the local sights but not somewhere we would choose to use again.,Negative
"I was at Kandalama for 2 nights with a large group of friends. I have been to the hotel more than 10 years back and first impression I got is that it looks the same still. Which is good as they have kept up with the same Eco-friendly architecture.First impression on the room was not good. We were in 4th floor. As we opened the door it was stinking. Bad smell maybe from bats. Room needed refurbishment. TV was a very old CRT TV which you don't expect in a 5 star hotel. Furniture was old and did not give us the 5 star feeling. Ac controls were not modern. Bedroom was too small.  Restaurant staff was not pro-active. We had to tell few times even to get us the serviettes, water, fork, knife, etc. When you ask them you get it soon, but you need to ask them always. At 5 star hotel we expect better. They have a nice infinity pool. It's nice but due to hot weather we did not enjoy much in pool. It lacks bit of shading for us locals.They really need to think about refurbishing the hotel soon before it gets any worse.",Negative
We culd not stay here...as The 'Front desk' is the worst horiible service i've met throughout Srilanka. Have you ever got the feeling that your not invited or wanted. They showed us rooms exactly opposite of what v had requested...Why would staff be so inattentive..The place looked serene but felt like only monks were invited...We had lunch till they get time to get back with the rates ...No one bothered...No one got back & they smiled as we left. Im yet in shock & so glad we stayed at Cinnamon Habarana instead.,Negative
"it seemed to be a bit rundown, I don't know if the standard of Hotels around them have gone up and they can't keep up or they just don't put as much love into the place as they used too but the most disappointing to me was the food. You go to Kandalama to eat, their buffets are world renowned, it broke my heart and my stomach at the average spread before me over three days, some explained that the weekend food is better as there are more people however that isn't good enough, it should be consistent for those people that come at off peak times. I write this with a broken heart for my once favourite hotel.",Negative
"We were on our honeymoon in Sri Lanka and this was our first stop. The potential this place has given it's setting and architecture is amazing, but sadly it's let down by a number of things. Primarily the service - to get a drink at dinner, we had to ask three times for a drinks menu and overall it took at least 20 minutes to get one. In the lounge areas we had to get up and search for a waiter if we wanted to have a drink. And our wake up call on our first morning was an hour early! The place feels unfinished. For example the main pool feels a bit like a building site and various other areas of the hotel just feel tired or abandoned. It's a shame because if properly managed, and with some attention to detail, this hotel could be amazing. And certainly for the price, it ought to be a lot better.",Negative
"My only jarring moments happened once my roomates and I had gone to bed, with the behaviour of the other guests on our floor. I had to get out of bed twice to tell people to (a) keep their noisy children in check at midnight - the kids were screaming and shouting and all the parents kept saying was ""shussh""; and (b) the Japanese ladies opposite who seemed to be having a party, again at midnight! Be warned and take earplugs.",Negative
we stayed there for two nights. during day time the hotels looks fine but as the sun sets there is an attack of lizards and bats from everywhere which was a huge drawback for people like me who are hell scared from such species. hotel is quiet huge and it was very tiring for us to walk from our room which was at one end to the restaurant which was at the other end. but the view from our room was amazing.. breakfast and dinner buffet were great. had wonderful time at the spa. although a bit expensive but the service at the spa was great.,Negative
"it is a huge hotel with plenty of rooms and plenty of people. busy, crowded, noisy. difficult to find a quiet place, especially the pool. the buffet breakfast is a mess. we might have been unlucky but our room had twice air conditioned and/or electricity problem; and above all we were right under the restaurant which meant almost non stop noise (chairs banging) from very early morning (setting breakfast buffet) until late at night (cleaning diner buffet). that was difficult to put up with.",Negative
"1) My direct online reservation with the property's Head Office Reservation Executives, took MORE THAN A MONTH to finalize my reservation due to delays and incompletions on their part. On the other hand, Cinnamon Lodge Hotel nearby, took less than a day to get back to me with a complete list and details for my initial inquiries. Had I been to Kandalama before, I would have selected the other property (which is reviewed equally well as Kandalama) to save my time and effort. 2) Check in- was not quick even though we arrived 1.5 hrs later than their official check in time (which is 2 pm). And the two luxury suites took the longest time for their check-in, with their best out of the two suites, was delayed 2.5 h from their check-in time and made us wait close to an hour outside after a tired day! Not a Luxury experience to begin with!! 3) House keeping in the rooms, although these were of their premium category (We booked their 2 luxury suites, one spa suite and one of their deluxe rooms), was definitely not 5 Star!! They were clean on ""average"", yet they also clearly lacked attention to the smallest (sometimes even the standard) detail which is expected of a true 5 Star Hotel. eg. Lightly dusted lamps (cob webs visible from the side) and side furniture, aged and shine less chrome fixtures and counter tops in bath room and also the stainless steel of their side-lamps in the room, hardened pre-deposits on their bath lotion bottle openings (which make one less hesitant to use them), and worst: not properly cleaned bathroom sinks and even the Jacuzzi which had deposits at their drain rims!!! AND aged and soiled commodes from lime water deposits!!!completely unacceptable for any 4-5 standard Property and the money they charge!! made me stay away from the bathroom as best possible when I reserved one with a Jacuzzi hoping to enjoy a nice, clean, fresh bath while enjoy their gorgeous nature view in private. Completely disappointed!! 4) Room power outlets and access to lighting were not easily accessible most of the time. Finding the patio light at the 7th floor luxury suite took us more than 15-20 min of our limited time. And there were no power outlet access to our US electronic appliances.5) Very uncomfortable (hard) furniture cushioning throughout the property including the in-room sofas/ and seats. While one appreciates the eco-friendly attempts and practices of this hotel, it should not compromise on the basic comforts like comfortably cushioning their furniture to enjoy the beautiful serene view everyone comes here to enjoy. 6) Lack of general common sense when preparing their rooms on a cold-rainy day. The coolers were left open even on the cold rainy day we arrived, thus, the in room temperature was not welcoming or cozy for us at all. Even after switching the coolers off, the room continued to retain it's cold temperature due to cold climate created through rain during many weeks of continuous rain in the area. It was made worse, since we were stuck in the hotel room, due to the nearby hiking surrounding was inaccessible due to flooding from the torrential rains as well. Although the hotel generally resides in a more arid region for the most part of the year, they need to make simple adjustments with common sense when exceptional weather arrives. 7) Complimentary services which are promised at the time of online reservation, but are NOT honored when arrived at the property: the spa suite reservation was ""claimed"" to come with one complimentary Head/ neck message each for two of the suite occupants. However, this was not honored nor acknowledged by the front desk staff when we inquired once we arrived at the Hotel. 8) Adding the point above as another example, evident inefficient communication within the Hotel Company! eg. Between their head office reservation executives and the onsite administrative staff. No record of my pre-partial payment for my reservation was available when we checked out at the Hotel. Luckily I had brought a printed copy of my pre-deposit receipt, therefore the transaction ended smoothly with no additional issue. Overall, it was not a 5 Star experience for the money I paid for! The hotel is definitely located in a serene beautiful nature surrounding for which travelers will continue to visit it for. And I will personally recommend anyone try this hotel at least once for that same reason! However, I will also strongly NOT recommend anyone to spend on more than the bare minimum required to stay here as well. If you've already experienced true 5 Star/ Diamond Hotels Internationally, the money you pay here expecting such level of luxury will NOT be delivered here.",Negative
"We stayed here for 2 nights in mid-July 2013 in a Deluxe Room. I think it is worth beginning by saying that we enjoyed our stay at the Kandalama very much, it is a hotel that has some considerable positives and if you are in the area, you could do an awful lot worse than to spend a night or two here. The design of the hotel is also hugely impressive, blending in to the landscape around it very well indeed. This attempt to integrate into the natural environment around it brought with it some positives from our point of view that, on balance, some other visitors may consider not so positive. The corridors and public areas to the hotel are open to the elements. At night bats fly up and down the corridors (which I was fascinated by). If, like me, you are a smoker, standing on your balcony for a cheeky smoke can be an enjoyable/terrifying experience first thing in the morning due to the sudden appearance of a handful of inquisitive monkeys. Again, I found this an added bonus, but it may not be to the taste of everyone (point of note: leave nothing you are not prepared to lose unattended on your balcony - I learnt this the hard way!). Also, whilst the rooms are a secure haven from this, in the evening the hotel - being lit up, as it is - does attract what seems like every insect in Sri Lanka. This is unavoidable - and not a criticism at all - and, as I said, the rooms are not affected by this, but it's worth bearing in mind if you really don't like creepy crawlies.I agree with previous reviewers that commented that the hotel in general looks a little shabby in parts and would probably benefit from a minor facelift. It really isn't bad though, just to be clear, and I think were the cost not so considerable, then this hyper-criticism may not be attracted at all. In addition, I also agreed with previous reviewers that were not overly impressed with the quality of food. Being a large hotel, the catering was geared toward large numbers (obviously) using a buffet-style approach. The rooms on the lower levels facing away from the lake are accessed through dark, dingy corridors (the back side of the hotel faces a sheer rock).",Negative
"Apologies if this review seems harsh but because the prices are so steep there is a minimum expectation to be met. The bedroom was certainly showing signs of wear and tear. The restaurant is geared towards the hordes and groups, providing mainly food for a western clientele (I didn't go to Sri Lanka to eat European food). The price of the buffet dinner was very expensive so to avoid the crowds and the overcooked bland European fare try the other restaurant (a la carte). It was slightly better.The hotel's setting is stunning but why is there is no character to the public areas. It all looks quite spartan and neglected. Inject the hotel with some character, make the staff cheerier, refurbish the bedrooms, improve maintenance standards and improve the quality of food and this could be a gem of a hotel.",Negative
"A total contrast to the other hotels we stayed in in Sri Lanka, which were all small boutique places with only a handful of other guests (if any!). Kandalama is vast, and the frequent disgorging of tour parties into the restaurant etc, plus the cavernous but soulless public areas and mild chaos of cabs, coaches and cases at the entrance ‘tunnel’, did make it feel more like an airport than hotel at times.Food seemed reasonable quality, though the buffet lunch we had after first arriving from the airport turned out to be extremely expensive in comparison to the rest of our holiday. A minor quibble, but there’s a culture of ‘over-service’ which some might be happy with but which kind of grated on us. For example, on our way back to our room, we stopped at the bar for a couple of beers, which we thought we’d take up to our balcony for sunset. No chance. You HAVE to have things brought to you in an obsequious manner, the idea that you might like to just buy a drink is impossible. So, despite asking several times, we ended having to walk away from the bar empty-handed, go up to our room, and dutifully wait 20 minutes for Room Service to deliver the very same beers we’d been looking at – and feel pressured to be grateful, offer a tip etc for the whole farce. All a bit pointless and unsettling – I don’t need to mollycoddled to the point of being made to feel incapable. It bugs me when a hotel thinks that this kind of service represents ‘luxury’, when in fact actually just cheerfully doing what your guests want works much better. Still, we got our own back the next day by buying beers in a local supermarket for about a sixth of the hotel’s price and smuggling them into our room – anarchy or what.",Negative
Hotel has good reviews but we were surprised!! The Hotel is not really in the jungle as advertised. Monkeys on the balcony and a great view but hard to imagine any jungle. We asked for a double room on check in but it never happened. Its a clever design built into a rock face but the Atmosphere is deadly. Only buffet available at best average and served in a school hall like atmosphere. The omlettes at breakfast very hit or miss as was the service. Very willing but cant deliver! The value by Sri Lankan standards was not good and we wished we had stayed elsewhere.,Negative
"The journey from Colombo to Dambulla , where the hotel is located is a long journey. I should say that it takes about 4 hrs to reach the hotel. The last few kms leading to the hotel feels like an african safari and is very intresting :). There is no humanity, you dont even spot another car !!!. Then the hotel stands there in all its glory in the middle of a vast, dense jungle. On entering the lobby of the hotel i thought it was a bit dull and sober. There was no grandeur , no frills and just barren corridors. In teh beginning i was a bit disspointed because i expected a grand hotel !!!. Only later did i realized that open spaces was what the hotel architect has envisaged. The hotel room is nice, but beware dont switch on your room lights for too long otherwise moths/insects will ruin your jacuzzi !!. The problem we faced at the hotel was that off dining. Thehotel has a very nice buffet but choices are very limited when it comes to alacarte. when we visited the hotel , it was not the peak season and hence it gets a bit gloomy and dull. the hotel is not very well lit and hence gets abit melancholy on the 1st night.",Negative
"after arriving early in the morning to colombo, we decided to take our time and look around the city. little did we know that the trip to Kandamala Hotel would take 4 hours by car. don't be fooled by the short distances in Sri Lanka, as a 40km ride can take more than one hour because of the narrow bumpy roads. the road to the hotel is an experience in itself, and is not for those who get car sick to say the least! i don't think i've ever seen a road so broken and bumpy. after reaching the hotel, after what seemed forever, we were pleasantly surprised by the open air and beautiful surroundings of the lake and trees. the staff are warm and friendly, and everyone walks barefoot. however, we did not like the bugs. there seemed to be more bugs in the hotel than outside. well, the hotel is entirely open air, so i wouldn't recommend it in the summer time, as i can imagine it being terribly hot and sticky. arm yourself with insect repellent, and mosquito spray for your skin. there are all kinds of bugs and any where you can imgine, from the elevator to the toilets. from grasshoppers to hug dung beetles...and even bats. so this place is not for the fainthearted - like me. The rooms are average, with a strange musty smell. the bathrooms are lovely, with a huge shower head so you feel like it's raining on top of you. the shower overlooks the jungle and sometimes monkeys will come to watch! :) there are monkeys everywhere in this hotel - don't forget you are in the jungle afterall. going to sri lanka - you must have a driver and a car, as this is the best way to go around. the buses are over crowed and dangerous, and the tuktuk cabs look like they are on suicide missions as all the trucks and cars over take them on the small narrow roads. ",Negative
"We stayed at the hotel kandalama for 2 nights as part of a tour of Sri Lanka.The location was beautiful, but took forever to get there from colombo due to the out of season monsoon rain! the bath did not work and the water was only luke warm, not what you want to lie in for a relaxing soak, we informed the reception and although several people traipsed in and out of the room 'trying' to fix it, we were not offered another room or was it ever fixed, i would also say that the rooms are way too dark and dingy! It doesnt lend itself well to the relaxed atmosphere it eminated! We spent the majority of our time out and about so we didnt spend any times in the pools, we only saw the one on the reception level that was lovely, due to its views but the pool itself is pretty small. The food was ok, not the best but acceptable. The hotel appeared empty, and when trying to have an extortionately priced drink in the lounge, 20 minutes later and no one was around to serve us. The bats in the halls can be a bit unnerving, especially when they swoop so low that they almost get caaught in your hair! An experience but next time where in sri lanka we will not stop here we will try a boutique hotel.",Negative
The service was poor. The cost of the meals was expensive- the drinks were very expensive. We were sharing a room with our daughter. There was no bed for her when we arrived. When it did arrive it was broken. There was only enough for 2 people each day and it got very boring ringing up for extra towels etc every day.,Negative
My husband and I went to Sri Lanka and the Maldives on honeymoon and stayed at Amaya Lake Resorts which were lovely.We had heard that the Kandalama Hotel was lovely to look at and had great food so we headed over there one evening for dinner. We opted for the Sri Lankan buffet which was very mediocre at best. The hotel itself was nothing to rave about - it wasn't a patch on Amaya Lake Resorts - I certainly wouldnt stay there.,Negative
"We stayed at this hotel for the first 3 nights of our trip to Sri Lanka. There are some amazing sites to visit in the area but the hotel proved disappointing on 3 main grounds: - The hotel was designed by Sri Lanka's leading architect, but it must have been on one of his off days. Alternatively, he liked to paint with a broad brush and let the detail take care of itself. The hotel's architecture is sweeping in its vision but not very pleasant for its guests. The public areas are grossly over specified with huge sweeping areas. The concrete structure is brutal and bleak and reminiscent of communist Eastern Europe. Overall it has the feeling of a huge multi-storey car park. Many of the features are simply badly conceived. The shopping mall (so-called) is in utterly the wrong place - it should be in the hotel. The pools are miserable and badly located and utterly unenticing. The walkways to the rooms are dark and eerie. Much of the detailing is also absurd; for example, we had to step into the bath to reach across to check the temperature of the water coming out of the bath tap; the lighting in the rooms is poor; stairways do not have rails for the bottom few steps and one can easily trip over the edge of the lower steps. The list is endless.- The interior design of the hotel is equally bleak. There are no pictures or other ornamentation apart from a few silly wood carvings on the landings which look like totem poles from British Columbia. The rooms have no decoration, the entrance corridor running through the rock cries out for some interior design treatment, the public furniture is tired and uncomfortable etc etc. - The service in the hotel is also pretty second rate. As everywhere in Sri Lanka, the staff are charming and helpful but the hotel cries out for decent management. It's not really spotlessly clean (cobwebs, smeared glass etc), the pillows are cheap and lumpy, the sheets and towels have seen better days, the communal self-service dining room is really a not very good canteen. We have stayed in many hotels in Asia and could not but reflect how different this hotel would be if it were to be managed by one of the top Asian chains. The location is stunning and with some retrofitting, interior design and competent managing, the hotel could be up there with the best. As it is, it is a pastiche of a great hotel and while not awful, leaves a lot to be desired. Having said that, we didn't hear of anywhere better in the vicinity.",Negative
"We were on honeymoon, so were a little disappointed when we were allocated a small room on the 2nd floor with no view of the tank. The room did look a little neglected too. The staff are good, although I'm not sure they really understand that good service is about being efficient as well as the 'personal chat' bit which sometimes got a bit grating.",Negative
"This hotel had quite a build-up from my husband and his family who are native Sri Lankans and have been there several times - I had high hopes, but was a bit let down. We booked four rooms about six months in advance, but were told when we arrived that since someone didn't call to confirm, our rooms had been ""released"" and since this was on Christmas Eve, there were no more rooms available. Probably our fault, but we weren't made aware we had to do that. After much debate, we ended up with the rooms. The room itself was just ok - it was large and had a nice view, but it was in desperate need of freshening up, the walls could use a new coat of paint, and the mold and dust in the room set my allergies off like crazy! I was miserable in there. And the pillows on the bed were the lumpiest things I have ever laid my head on. The rest of the hotel is nice (definitely not five star in my opinion, even though there's a plaque on the wall that says it is) and I love how eco-friendly it is, but it seems to be past it's prime and they're not doing a good job of keeping it up. We had a MUCH better expereince at Ahungalla, which is also own by the Heritance group - would HIGHLY recommend that one.",Negative
Our rooms were fine and the beds comfy but the sheer size of the hotel off putting.When you went in the dining room it was like and aircraft hanger Massive and had nothing special about it.The noise and kids running round were awful.Food was buffett and not bad but the servce was dreadful.Badly trained staff hanging round talking and not working!,Negative
We checked twice by phone that they had accommodation for a driver and guide. When we arrived with a female guide they advised us that they only had male accommodation (we did not have this problem in other hotels). We were asked to pay full price for a double room plus the season supplement (even though they had empty rooms) for our guide!!!!!!!!! This was about 8pm so we had no option but pay though we did get a bit of discount when the duty manager phoned the general manager in Colombo!!!!,Negative
"We had read so many good things about the Kandalama Hotel that we were expecting an elegant experience. The hotel itself is actually a little disappointing given all of the build up. The suite that we had provided a comfortable bed for us, but a poor quality roll away bed for our son. He ended up moving the thin matress to the floor in order to be more comfortable. The sitting room had two couches, but neither was particularly comfortable to sit on.My real problem with the Kandalama is that it is a larger hotel than I like on a vacation - this is my problem, not the hotel's. The impact of the size, however, was felt in the dining. The main dining room is a cavernous room in which only buffets are served. It is noisy, smokey (especially when they are grilling food) and incredibly crowded. At breakfast, it felt as though dozens of tour buses had pulled up and deposited their passengers at the buffet. I don't enjoy buffets as all of the food is prepared in industrial proportions. Accordingly, it tends to lack any subtelty. There is a fine dining alternative for dinner, which we did opt for on one evening. While the food at the fine dining restaurant was actually very good, the service was painfully slow. It took us over three hours to be served a three course meal.",Negative
The bathroom posed challenges since the spigots for the deep tub were unreachable unless you got into the tub. Hotel was very busy with Sri Lankan families who were enjoying the swimming pools and buffet meals. The toque macaques provided lots of entertainment. In fact one night we were awakened by crashing sounds on our balcony. The next morning we discovered furniture upended etc. Macaques were busily climbing about and rushing back and forth.,Negative
"I thought the front desk people at the hotels were supposed to be guest friendly. However that does not seem to be the case here. The front desk people are very unfriendly and very different from the other staff. They do not wish to handle the guests in a polite way.They were trying to charge 30 USD per night for our 5 year old kid saying it is for providing Child meal when we had actually paid already for the meals she ate with us. When questioned, they did not have any explanation or were unwilling to give any explanation and said it is their policy to charge for any child above 2 years without any reason. When pushed further they tried to say our travel agent had cheated us and they would not charge for child if we had booked directly on their website.Ended up getting back from the hotel with a sour feeling due to the approach of the front desk folks but otherwise had a good experience",Negative
"the dark and dingy corridors at night, mattresses outside rooms as you walked past. Not very professional. There were a plethora of staff, but we were never really sure what they all did. I counted 11 in reception one day, however, not one of them were able to give me change of a 2000 note, and the buying of two stamps became a monumental issue, as did all small issues at this hotel. We were also asked to prove in writing that we had indeed booked half board at this hotel, which made me flip a lid! The staff were not forthcoming in being proactive or enthusiastic; it was slow, very slow or dead slow. We both found staying at the Heritance a rather dour experience and we moved one day earlier because of this. The pool with its stunning view was great, but I always felt is was a bit of a trauma for someone to bring a drink to the pool. It was not welcoming and the same can be said of the bar in the evenings; uncomfortable furniture and no atmosphere at all. Not somewhere where you wanted to hang around.This hotel needs to get its act together, and motivate the staff, bring comfort and light into the communal areas. They did do a great New Year’s Eve party but after that it was as flat as a pancake. After a long day out exploring you just wanted a cosy corner to relax with a drink, but that was not possible at the Heritance.",Negative
"Probably best I preface this review by saying that large hotels are not my cup of tea so this possibly tarnishes my opinion. Highlights for me are the stunning location, the modern rooms and bathrooms, the helpful staff and the facilities like the shops, pools and gym. Lowlights were our diabolical first room, (they moved us twice), over-priced restaurant food and wine(compared to all the other hotels we stayed in). Unfortunately our first choice Vil Uyana was full.",Negative
"We were 4 couples that travelled together and when I made the online booking, I specifically requested that we have adjoining rooms or at least on the same floor. When we checked in, the rooms assigned to us were far from adjoining; they were on a separate floor and separate wing. If my wife and I needed to go out for dinner, it was quite an effort firstly to locate either my parents or brother's room but also getting to it, so we could leave our daughter with them...which brings me to the layout... to get from the 4th floor to the second, one had to go either to the third or the first floor and walk one flight down or up... the hallways were dark, poorly lit and in some cases, sign boards were absent. Considering the size of the property, the room service menu in the room clearly states the delay in getting to the room - and they weren't kidding. When we got cold soup, one of the waiters used this as an excuse!!Oh and i think some of the earlier reviewers alluded to this... Bugs! I'm from India and we have a problem as well so I don't want to come across as a whining traveller but the size of the mozzies here were 3 times what we find back home.... I was quite worried for my daughter. Even the pool on the upper floor couldn't be used with bugs all over the water.",Negative
"you can't really sit out there because the monkey's that roam around like they own the place, use the balcony's like a toilet, so they are quite dirty, which is a real shame.Watch out for the monkey's, we caught one sliding open our patio door! They can also be a little aggressive.",Negative
"less than i expected. i had a big room but it is not at all up to standard, very old TV, no good channels, low value for your money and weak internet connection, nice scenery, no elephants, only one and paid 100 usd to see and ride. food is not good but normal. road to get to that hotel is awful.",Negative
"The restaurant is pretty bad, the only one that was open during our stay had very bad food and I got poisoned on my first night there and even had to call a doctor to the hotel.Make sure you have your own driver for tours and transportation(can get one through a tour agency) coz the hotel charges a lot for it.",Negative
"we were disappointed mainly because our expectations had been set so high from the website. We booked the Royal Suite and looked forward to our butler, gifts, canapes, champagne, tea cannister, pillow menu and chocolates as described on the website. It sounds amazing. None of these things materialised. We did get a fairly ordinary bottle of merlot which arrived around 9pm after we had had dinner on the first night. The chocolates consisted of one mini mars bar and a packet of polos (this to be shared between 4 of us - so not exactly generous). We asked about all the extras and were told that they had stopped doing gifts but would see what could be arranged. We eventually got a small box of chocolates and a canister of tea - so not as described. The dining room was impersonal and service very rushed - one waiter actually tookj a call on him mobile while serving us - something I'd never seen allowed anywhere before. The food was OK but nothig special given the price and the tea in the monring was stewed and undrinkable. Also breakfast buffet largely depleted by 9am when we ate. So overall disappoinging despite stunning location.,",Negative
"ood and drink are incredibly expensive, the rooms are a bit tired and because the hotel is so huge, it has a very strange atmosphere (very empty). We tried to take a swim at the pool on the top floor but the water was green (not sure when it was last cleaned). So we swam in the infinity pool instead - which was very nice and relaxing. It was definitely an experience but not one that we would repeat if we return to Sri Lanka.",Negative
"no food for vegeterians like us as they have very limited veg food, including nothing for Indians unless specifically requested. also while rooms are reasonably priced, food is far too expensive",Negative
"What was disappointing was the smell of sewage in our room. Our room was a Royal suite at the very end of the Sigiriya wing room 217. Despite complaints to the front desk, nothing was done to help us with the situation - no scented candle, no deodorant. Certainly they did not offer to change rooms. Its a shame because our stay was superb except for this issue. ",Negative
"It is an odd sort of place, and we didn't see it in the best light. February is reckoned to be a dry, hot month, but we encountered torrential rain, floods and low cloud. The roads and tracks to the hotel were nigh impassable, and the reception area - which is built into the side of a rock face - was somewhat dark and forbidding, with pumps running and copious towels spread across the floor. We were allocated a room at the furthest extremity of the wing detached from the main body of the hotel, and were greeted by a large family of monkeys, which had congregated on our balcony - no doubt sheltering from the deluge. A notice advised us not to open the door to the balcony, as the monkeys would rush in and pinch food and anything else that took their fancy.The room itself was quite comfortable, but it took 4 minutes at a brisk pace to reach the restaurant. And the monkeys occupied their time at daybreak by fighting noisily with each other.The service was not the best we encountered in Sri Lanka",Negative
"Our memory of this hotel will be three sleepless nights. We stayed in room 438 and this faced in the direction of the sewage treatment facility (hidden in the jungle). A loud whine came from this plant which kept us awake, we complained to reception but as the hotel was full they said they were unable to help. They need to accoustically modify this plant.The architecture and general setting are impressive with the feeling of being close to nature. Travelling around Sri lanka takes longer than you expect on poor roads so the long access road is another annoyance. Take plenty of money, extra's come with 22% service charge etc.",Negative
"I do feel, though, that now the place has become such a fixture it's started to rest on its laurels, content to process endless waves of upmarket package tourists rather than create a personal, magical experience for each guest. Because of its remoteness guests are essentially captive, and the management take advantage of this with extremely high food and drink prices, which we accepted as the price of such a lovely setting but which did leave a slightly bad taste in the mouth. Also, this time we didn't have our own transport, and were charged a shocking 30 dollars for a cab to Dambulla, which really is daylight robbery; again, I felt they were taking advantage of the fact we were stranded there. We asked for a tuktuk and they refused to get us one, until we kicked up a fuss and they caved in. It's a shame, because with more imaginative and less greedy management this could be a world class hotel.",Negative
"Heritance Kandalama Hotel is a hyped destination hotel with an average offering at incredibly expensive prices. Room rates if booked on the internet around USD 270 - if booked through the hotel reservation desk - the same room is USD 450 - all per night per room! Once you get there you are hostage to the hotel's exorbitant pricing; USD 75 for a dinner buffet with limited selections - truly - how many types of sausages can one stomach - and besides, food in a ""hole in the wall in the village for a fraction of the price 10 times more tasty; USD 50 plus for very poor quality wine; kids running around tables screaming; uninformed staff - in all - for a seasoned traveler - very disappointing.",Negative
"Food pretty good - we had half board and the buffet style food was good. BUT other food (lunches etc) and drinks are incredibly expensive, four times as much as our (5*) hotel in Colombo and there are no alternatives. You can't get a tuk tuk outside because the drive is about a mile long and a taxi into town is not cheap.. I felt a bit ripped off by this, which is why I have only given 3 stars - would otherwise have been 5. Be aware you can't use the balconies - the monkeys pee on the tables, steal things and try to get into the room.",Negative
"We made a special trip into the dark jungles of Dambulla and rickety roads to get to this much talked of hotel. Thought the frontage is quite spectacular and famous, i would not consider staying there for the service or the food! There was also something dying over the front driveway or some garbage that needed to be cleaned up. The food was so dissapointing and very overpriced. Very small menu too outside of the obligator 'buffet'. What I ordered a la carte was not at all what was described on the menu, a scrap of processed cheese and a sliced franfurter at London prices!Where we stayed nearby was outstanding by comparison...the Habarana Lodge. A separate review on that.",Negative
The food though was very poor and extremely expensive. The desk staff/management over-promised and under-delivered. More of a hotel for tour groups than for families overall- it had a tour group ambience.,Negative
"- It is very isolated and therefore the hotel can price high and does. For example the only transport available is the hotel's own, no taxi's no tuk tuks allowed anywhere near so if you have no car you have no choice but to pay very high prIces to get to Dambulla town or visit Sigiriya. - There is a monkey problem, nice to look at but they can get a bit aggressive. - Buffet food is disappointing - I was hoping for something more local than a Mongolian selection. - Finally the British Manager conducts his business loudly and self importantly (beer in a an ice bucket!!) from a table on the outside veranda, I just found this really annoying. These are small moans but if you are paying top rate the hotel experience needs to match, don't be put off this is a good place to spend a night or 2.",Negative
"We stayed here with a group of friends for one night during our trip to and were really disappointed in the service and how we were treated. However, our room was located literally next door to a building site. The noise when we first entered the room was unbearable and we immediately requested a room change from the porter. He said he would see what he could do. Our friends who we were travelling with got allocated rooms also, theirs were in the other wing of the hotel, which was completely fine. 2 hours later, they said that a room was ready for us. Which turned out to be literally upstairs to the previous one - beside the building site, this time there were blackout sheets on the windows, as the building was going on right on top of us. We complained again and the reception said that the hotel was full and there was nothing they could do. We requested a refund or partial refund and our request was ignored. We went and spoke to the manager who said that he would speak to the builders and tell them to stop work (!!). This isn't really acceptable for a hotel with this rating. If your hotel rooms are next to a building site - you need to warn your customers! We tried not to let this ruin our stay, but didn't think this was acceptable.",Negative
"This hotel location is very unique. It is just in the middle of the jungle, you need to drive inside the jungle for 10 mins till you reach the hotel and it is a big surprise to find such a beatifull hotel in this place. The rooms are spacious and the views are good. The swimming pool is great also but there are lots of insects going inside the room because the rooms are exposed and the halls are in the jungle. We did not see any monkeys in our two days stay although it is mentioned that they are wandering around the hotel but I guess that was because we leaved early morning everyday.This hotel is good if you have a driver and a car because nothing is there around the hotel and you cannot even have a walk outside after sunset so there are no activities. The service was satisfactory but room service was slow and the food was good but not wow. This hotel is recommended for one night or two at the most but not more than that.",Negative
Service is a bit suspect - my wife fell ill with a stomach bug the day after we checked in and the response was not great till I called the general manager after which they got a doctor to see her.The only negative was travel time to and from Colombo - it took about 4.5 hours in a mini bus with 10 of us.,Negative
"Let me preface this review by saying that we normally don't stay in hotels of this size, so perhaps I am not being fair, but we really did not enjoy our stay at Heritance Kandalama. Firstly, it took us a long time to find the hotel as the signage leading up to the property from the main road is quite poor. However, on arrival we were quite wowed by the size and design of the reception. Unfortunately, the room did not follow this. The room felt very dated and slightly dusty. We were upgraded to a room with a jacuzzi tub, which was very kind of them, but when taking a shower in the tub, it was impossible not to flood the bathroom, so we spent most of the evening wading through wet towels. To be fair to the hotel, they did clear up the water as soon as we requested. The dining hall reminded us of our school canteens. The food is distinctly average - we are not buffet people - so we tended to fill up on fruit! The acoustics of the canteen are awful and being there just before Xmas, it was very noisy and overrun with children (even at 10pm!). There is a fine dining restaurant, but it was empty both nights we were there so did not seem that appealing.",Negative
"We recognized king coconut juice, but there were two other juices that we weren't familiar with. When we enquired about the drinks and asked for a sample, the guy gruffly told us, ""Hurry up, we have other guests to serve."" (The restaurant was nearly empty at the time.) Other than this negative first impression, we had an enjoyable stay, despite the dim lighting in the room, overly fluffy pillows and lizards on the walls.If you're afraid of creepy crawlies, this hotel is not for you. They have wall lizards that prowl the corridors at night, bats that fly around (It is eco-friendly after all), roaches of all sizes scurrying along, and a musty bat smell in the lower corridors.The view is to die for, especially since the bathroom has one glass wall and you can see monkeys scampering around from your shower.",Negative
"We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights in december and it wasn't that great. The room though nice smelled really bad. they moved us over, but that one reaked too. We think that reason was because of a door the two rooms share on the wall since my uncles room smelled fine. Do not go to this hotel in winter time since it is the rainy season andif it rains, it rains for the whole day.the architecture was pretty cool but our room was pretty far out which was a hard walk for my grandparents.The cost was too high though. the monkeys add a cool environmental feeling to the hotel but one time when I was coming home to the room a monkey chased me, so beware.",Negative
"It seemed to be more or less a conference centre set in the jungle. Lots of corporate events which made it seem very impersonal- and at times very crowded. The food was the most expensive of any of the hotels we stayed in, most of which were high class- and there was absolutely nowhere else to go to eat. As an example apple pie and ice cream cost more here than an entire ( and very good) buffet in a medium hotel we stayed in- about 1200 rupees plus 25% taxes, which is considerably more than the average daily wage in Sri Lanka! I had the feeling they were milking the view. There wasn't much else to do as the area was lacking in walks apart from the approach road. Most people only stay one night. We much preferred Vil Uyana and Cinnamon Lodge, for which see my separate reviews.",Negative
"On our honeymoon, booked 2 nights here, very dissappointed with the overall service of the hotel staff. expected 5 star service from such an expensive resort, but difficult to obtain even small things like adaptors- had to call reception twice for it and waited over 45mins to get one! staff seem disorganised, not as pleasant, friendly or prompt as staff in other hotels (we had amazing service at Earls regency in kandy - another aitken spence hotel). my husband had called in advance to ask them to prepare our room specially for our honeymoon, but nothing was done, he went back to reception 3 times during the first day & asked them to surprise me, eventually after dinner, housekeeping came & folded a bedsheet in a decorative way, that was all. food was tasty but very expensive. service charge is very high. would not stay here again.",Negative
"Inspite of staying there for just a day due to prior bookings, the staff at the reception was not at all hospitable. Highly overpriced for the amenities provided. The staff however had a missing warmth factor and none of them had a smile to wear. We are not paying those extra loads of money to watch sad faces for every humble request one has during the stay. Definitely not to be recommended to friends and family. There should be a well cultured staff who pays head to the requests of the clients without being judgmental in the approach.",Negative
"We have been guests of this hotel on several short stay holidays with our friends and family since it opened in the mid 1990s. When we arrived at the hotel, the front desk insisted that only the person who made the reservation (who was parking the vehicle at the time) could fill in the check in forms despite the fact that I had handed the guest relations person a printout of our online booking confirmation and wanted to start filling in the check in forms. Not a great start, despite the scented wet face towel and the lotus flower!After a day of trekking and sightseeing, it can be an effort to dress up for dinner, and we really wanted to relax using the in-room dining facility for dinner. We felt that the hotel discouraged guests from ordering room service as the menu was limited, overpriced, and to our utter dismay, the food was mediocre, at best. The Club Sandwich (which cost almost double of what one would pay at another 5 star hotel) what was probably the worst cub sandwich we have ever tasted. The grilled chicken was bland and the pickle which accompanied the sandwiches was just vegetables in coloured salt water! ""Out-of-this-world"" is how we've described food at Kandalama in the past. To compare with another hotel in the “Heritance” range, the in-room dining and restaurant meals at Heritance Ahungalla during our stay in June 2011 was good value for money.The hotel should acquire a few more DVD players, so that guests who stay in rooms where a DVD player is not a standard amenity, can obtain one (even at a fee), for the period of their stay! We requested a DVD player which was eventually installed (further to housekeeping and maintenance departments taking forever to find a ‘multi-plug’ so that they didn’t have to disconnect the mini bar to plug in the DVD player!), and the following afternoon, the reception called to ask if we had ""finished watching the movie"", so that they can give the DVD player to another guest. To be fair, as we hadn't ""finished watching the movie"" we were 'allowed' to keep the player till next morning.Perhaps first time guests will still consider Heritance Kandalama to be one of the best in Sri Lanka, but we as repeat guests whose expectations were high from past experiences from a time when the hotel staff went out of their way to accommodate simple (and of course reasonable) requests from guests, will now think twice before we pay the premium rates stay there again.",Negative
"The location for this hotel is truely spectacular. We ate in the a la carte resturant for our evening meals (buffet was the other option) Service & food were average on the first night & better on the second. However on the second evening my husband found a piece of plastic in his soup! Although stuff happens & the waiter apologized, they should not have charged us for that dish. Service in general was not up to a 5* hotel in my opponion. The infinity pool was set in a great location but was let down my the rather worn out towels. I also had an issue with laundry I sent. It took three phone calls and me having to go to the front desk to find out when it was being returned. ",Negative
"Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. A good place however seems to be slightly overhyped, probably because there are no better hotels in this area. Had booked a Lake view room with specific instructions for a best view room. However upon arrival was told that we were upgraded to a suite, which we found at no view at all and was in some corner of the hotel with a hill right in front of the room just a couple of meters away. Therefore refused to check in and for a upgrade thereafter was told that the hotel was full and there was only one room with the lake view. This room too was at the corner with a partial in fact a negligible view of the hotel. How such specific instructions can be taken for granted? Especially with the booking was done more than a month in advance and moreover called the hotel just hours before the check in saying that I was on my way from the Airport. Was assured of a better room the next day which was given. Other than this the check in process and the stay was good. Rooms were in good condition.However the service in the Restaurant was just not up to the mark. It seemed that we are invisible to them and only a particular group was looked after this changed only after I brought it to the notice of the Restaurant Manager on the 1st night.All in all customers it seems are taken for granted unless they make themselves noticed and gives a impression that you are the unwanted ones.",Negative
"This is a stunning hotel in a beautiful location and it's all about the setting. Curves and lines lead the eyes to the view at all times. Sitting on the terrace overlooking the infinity pool was magic. Some of the corridors verge on the industrial austerity but never cross the line from understated elegance.The service was excellent and whilst prices for a cool beer and some light nibbles was higher than other places, it wasn't exorbitant. This was a great diversion after visiting the Dambulla Caves and on our way to Sigiryia. Worth a visit even if not staying",Negative
"We started visiting Kandalama last year and have been here twice now. I guess it’s a old nostalgia which makes us come back each year - but the hotel does need a face lift. Food is always ever so excellent - almost the best buffet in Sri Lanka - though post pandemic cost optimization is evident in the spread - but still a good spread and tickles the taste buds. Rooms are run down - but the views are to die for - we always stay at the Sigiriya wing - and it’s such a vibe to wake up to views of Sigiriya. Ambience at the hotel is very pleasant - where the team has made efforts to offer entertainment - live music, excursions etc, but could use an upgrade. The staff at the hotel is the best part! We love them! From the front desk to the waitstaff - excellent. We will be returning again this year for our weekly homage - but would love to see a facelift!",Negative
"We visited this hotel recently for a short getaway. This hotel is located in the middle of the jungle and close to the Kandalama Lake. The hotel is designed to merge with the surrounding environment which is very interesting to see. If you stay in this hotel, I suggest you to walk around the hotel. The hotel surrounding and the interior of the hotel is very unique. Hotel has almost all the luxuries similar to a typical hotel, but it seemed to have a minimum impact to the natural environment, which I really admire.There are two pools that we used in this hotel. The most interesting pool was the pool in the higher elevation. It is actually constructed with a natural rock formation. This location has a nice view of the lake too.If you come with friends or family, this hotel has many places for you to gather around and relax playing a card game or have a nice chat.In the evenings when its dark, it really feels like we are in a jungle. It is peaceful and very relaxing.However, I have seen some areas that have some room for improvement.Although some staff members are friendly and helpful, most of the staff members are not friendly or professional. The service of a hotel in this caliber must be designed to feel guests welcome and comfortable. But in some occasions we did not feel this.Hotel has its luxurious facilities, both in and out of the rooms / suites, however, one thing to keep in mind is that since this is an old hotel, lots of wear and tear can be seen everywhere. Also, guests please beware of the old tiles in the bathrooms, which are very slippery when wet.Even though we had planned to leave the hotel around 10.00 am, we were emphasized (several times at the check-in) that we have to handover the suite keys before 12.00 noon and we ""may"" stay in the hotel property for another hour or so. I don't think this is acceptable. Specially because I know for a fact that, there will be no check-ins waiting to occupy our suites when we vacate the suites on that day. In these types of vacationing hotels, I often see flexibility in timings if there are no new check-ins. I think it is important to prioritize the comfort of the guests rather than sticking to policies.The buffets we had were very good. There were number of options to select and the taste of the food was very good too. I specially liked the action stations they had.However, the quality of the room service food needs to be improved.Although the rooms are generally clean, I think there is a big room for improvement in this aspect.While there are some areas that need improvements, considering the experience we had in our visit, I can recommend this hotel for a short getaway. I am sure you will leave the hotel at the end of your stay with a happy, relaxed, and satisfied mind.",Negative
"Stayed for 3 nights as part of our honeymoon. There are many exceptional parts of the hotel however there are a number of simple changes that could be made to elevate the overall experience to the 5 star rating the hotel carries. We enjoyed our stay very much so and we hope the hotel find this feedback useful in improving the overall guest experience. There are some other aspects of the hotel which need improved but we assume these are a victim of low/zero investment during COVID 19. POSITIVES: Hotel Location & Setting: There is no question that the hotel property is a stand out in Sri Lanka and beyond. The views from the rooms over Lake Kandalama are second to none and the hotel is well situated to visit attractions such as Sigiriya Rock, Minneriya / Hurulu National Park & Dambulla Cave temples. Rooms: large and spacious, well furnished and maintained. Slightly tired in places but overall up to the standard expected of a 5 star hotel and the hotel’s reputation. Cleanliness: hotel and rooms are very clean and staff use COVID-19 protocols to help prevent the spread of covid and ensure guests feel safe. Staff: The staff are very friendly, welcoming and helpful always making effort to accommodate requests. In room dining, cleaning and turn down services were all very good. The hotel driver who took us to Sigiriya was brilliant. NEGATIVES: Food: The food offering in the hotel restaurants is below the expectation for a 5 star hotel, with the exception of the buffet which the quality was good but was very overpriced if not on an all inclusive rate. The offerings in the a la carte restaurant are limited and poorly executed. This restaurant would be far better with a simpler menu of local foods using fresh ingredients instead of an expansive offering of international dishes which are not great (ie pizza, chips etc) and we expect come from frozen. It would be good if some of the in room dining options were also available at the terrace above the infinity pool (I.e fried rice, curry etc). Pool Areas: The pools themselves are great, in particular the infinity pool, but there are no where near enough sun loungers to the number of guests. The hotel should invest in additional sun loungers which could sit on the grassed roof areas on upper floors, which are currently wasted space, to act as sun terraces. Additionally, simply using walkie talkies or QR code ordering to take F&B orders at the pool instead of expecting guests to seek out staff in the bar to order would be a vast improvement on the current setup. Bar: the bar area feels wasted and the service is slow. There is a space for staff near the dining area which would perhaps be better suited to a bar with the staff area nearer to the kitchen. Check in/out: the staff are great, but the whole process is slow. Oddly on check out you have to go into a separate room to make payment, luckily we left early and so there was no queue but I imagine there are instances where this occurs which is crazy given the space given to the lobby. Overall, the hotel has amazing parts to it and others which need to catch up to match the reputation, 5 star rating, location and setting. We don’t want to put off potential visitors as the hotel itself is worth it but calibrate expectation of the food and overall experience to that of 3/4 star as opposed to 5 star",Negative
The room was so clean and nice..not to mention the service of staff..supportive and kind. As an place surrounded with green environment we really enjoyed our night out. Food also tasty.bith breakfast and lunch..we loved traditional varieties and Kolakanda.,Negative
"This hotel is off the beaten track, and secluded. Great outlook. The rooms are adequate, but dark, and in need of refurb to bring them up to International standards. When shown to our room, we were advised to keep the balcony doors closed otherwise the monkeys may gain entrance! The best thing about this hotel is the food.A great international buffet is available for both breakfast and dinner, including BBQ items, with alcoholic beverages served to your table at dinner. A great location for touring with many attractions within 30 to 40 minutes drive, including Elephant safari, Cave temple, village experiences etc.",Negative
"Amazing Location, Nice Rooms and a View, Environment friendly and cool and calm without any noisy,also can do a birds watching and elephant riding too. Friendly staff and a excellent service. Very Clean rooms and Wash rooms",Negative
"We decided to stay overnight in this hotel with two other families as it was school vacation for our kids, I happened to visit the place after 11 years, and expecting the same great experience I had, Our check in time was 2:00pm and we reached the hotel at around 2:30pm, though it was a fully booked weekend, the staff members were trying their best to accommodate and welcome us, I booked three rooms but one room was not ready and it was 3:15 pm when that room was given, omplementary fruit basket and one hour late departure was offered, since they had a mistake in their side. We had a great time at restaurant, where kids were enjoying thoroughly with the mouthwatering food offered and the larger variety had. Staff at the restaurant did their best to accommodate guests since it was a fully booked day.Pool staff were also very supportive, we (including kids) enjoyed two swimming pools, but we didn’t use the natural pool at 7th floor.We enjoyed the music played and traditional dances performed by its own staff and it was commendable!!!Rooms were okay, (we stayed in Deluxe Rooms in 4th floor in Sigiriya Wing) but felt that bathroom fittings should be given some attention, since it appeared old and observed some moulds in taps and sinks.

"Lovely but VERY big hotel. We were possibly fortunate to visit slightly out of season when it wasn't at its busiest. The entrance is quite amazing with a walk through a tunnel of blasted rock into a big expanse of space that overlooks the infinity pool and stretches out for miles into the distance over a beautiful lake. Monkeys abound and, if you are not alert, you will find all of your fruit and other things rapidly disappearing from your room. We sat on our balcony one morning eating breakfast and enjoying the view but had to continually protect our food. Not a problem, just something to be aware of. The rooms are a good size and in good order. Nice white fresh linen and every time the rooms is made up the cleaner leaves an incredible animal made from towels on the bed. We had an elephant and a dog. Really clever how it is folded. Like towel origami.The hotel is perfectly situated for Sigiriya (lion Rock) which is well worth a visit. Equally well positioned for Minneriya National Park and Kaudulla National Park where you can see wild elephants roaming from a Jeep. There are a LOT of Jeeps though. Hundreds of Jeeps which all converge on any Elephant they can find. I'm not overly convinced it is in any way ecologically sensitive.We ate at the buffet restaurant the two nights we were there. It is a truly amazing spread with local, European and Far Eastern dishes. Dozens of things to choose from and everything we had was very good.The hotel is built on a cliff and looks wonderful from outside as it has creepers growing all over it. Being on the cliff means you enter at the 5th floor which is where the bar and main swimming pool are. The main restaurant is on the 6th flood and there is an a la carte restaurant on the 7th floor along with another pool. The hotel has a good spa and we had a 90 minute full body massage there which was pretty good.",Negative
