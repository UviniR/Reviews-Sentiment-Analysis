"Highly recommended luxury stay !
I spent my honeymoon there. Support given by each and every hotel members are marvelous, specially Mr. Dilanka Thirimanne.
Place is wonderful. Thank you all for your lovely service !",Positive
Great,Positive
"Buildings are old. The bathroom and the fridge etc was dirty. Overall room cleanliness should be improved. In addition it is crowded. Workers are good, but normally sri lankans provide good hospitality even if you go to a village home.",Negative
"A truly beautiful Hotel built by Bawa with a spectacular view surrounding the entire hotel. One of my favourite places to visit in Sri Lanka as the experience is not like any other üòÅ.

The staff were incredibly friendly and so homely. Thank you Kandalama staff for your hospitality, I can't wait to come back again üòÜ‚ù§Ô∏è!!!",Positive
Excellent stay with the calm and quiet adding to a wonderful holiday. The service was amazing and the food very good. I totally enjoyed my stay.,Positive
"If you want to stay in this hotel you must try 5 th floor upwards ,room number 501-518 are better , you can have a better view of the lake ,other Rooms in 5 th floor, the view is covered by trees and you can‚Äôt see the lake",Positive
"Highly recommend!
Stayed in Luxury suite. I would highly recommend to anyone for a luxurious and unforgettable hotel experience. With its stunning location, exceptional service, and world class cuisine, it‚Äôs truly one of the best hotels in Sri Lanka.",Positive
"This one is all location. At a distance from Sigriya Rock and comfortable . An older property, so to be prepared for that.",Positive
Excellent travel destination üòäüòä,Positive
"Strangely unpleasant place. Food 4/5. Room 3/5. Check in experience 0/5. Service 2/5. Value for money 1/5. Even if offered a free suite, I would never go back. A bad hotel can have a good view and still be a bad hotel. Most of the reviews are fake, notice how many of the reviewers have only written 2 reviews for example.",Negative
Best place in the world,Positive
"Incredible hotel. They gave us a 2nd floor room for the first night even though we wanted a Lakeview. For the second night they upgraded us at no cost.

Great opportunity to see monkeys up close, you just have to be careful and respectful.",Positive
Architectural miracle and master piece by the great Jeffrey bawa. Great food and ambience..the staff has made the wifi passwords are too complicated..apart from that everything is fine.,Positive
"Exceptional.

We stayed in kandalama and it was a delightful experience. Staff was extremely helpful and very polite. The food was out of this world. We really enjoyed the buffets which had a massive variety and choices to compliment one another. The hotel itself was stunning. This is a must stay if you havent been. Hats off to the kandalama team for making it an unforgettable stay. Keep up the good work.",Positive
Great location with great scenery. Hospitality could have improved as they don't provide the extras included in the package unless you ask.,Positive
As always a great experience. Thank you to Dhilanka and his team. Always available to cater to all our needs.,Positive
Great hotel with magnificent view of the lake. Stayed for one night. Delicious food and really enjoyed the stay.,Positive
It was a wonderful experience and provided a comfortable stay,Positive
Had one of the best stays in the hotel. Amazing views and took a great break from the daily rush. Yoshina from the guest relations team was very helpful throughout the stay and took care of our entire group which was a large group of 16. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The awurudu events were organized very well and we enjoyed all of them. The pools were beautiful and maintained very well. Hands off the best 4 days we've spent in a hotel.,Positive
Great experience...!!!,Positive
"We had such a pleasant Avurudu holiday at the Kandalama Hotel. The highlight being the typical village setting and Avurudu activities that had been planned for the guests: it was done excellently well and everyone enjoyed the fun and entertaining performances especially by the village idiot and compere.
The hotel staff were very helpful and courteous and went the extra mile to make it a relaxing holiday. The food was excellent and the rooms were very comfortable with breathtaking views of the exotic splendor of our country.

Thank you team Kandalama!",Positive
not bad.,Negative
"It was not a good experience as others views it. It was so crowded and had fewer staff to support guest arrivals. A lot of guests waited more than one hour to check in. We were allocated 2 floors which is the basement. We requested higher rooms at any price but it was not materialized. Finally, we decided to change the hotel to another. We may be the few guests who turn back from this kind of 5-star hotel. Although there were good comments, it was not well organized and need more staffs to be employed. Will see again with good hopes...
When you book rooms please ask the level or floor of the rooms. If you get 2 and 3 floors .. you don‚Äôt have view and dark view. Entrance side only rock. I think better to select from 4th floor and above.",Positive
"We went for our honeymoon, and I just can't recommend this hotel enough. The room was awesome, with literally all the facilities you could ask for. The food was top-notch as well. The staff was really friendly and helpful. They had somehow missed some complimentary items that they give for the honeymoon offer, and once it was notified, a manager came and personally apologized for their mistake and gave us homemade jam and a chocolate platter in a wooden box. This was really an awesome experience.",Negative
Highly recommended.  Excellent service    from all staff members.  Belend  with nature  atmosphere.,Positive
Great place,Positive
"In my opinion, Heritance Kandalama is the best hotel in SriLanka. It‚Äôs on a level which is in matched level from others. Great food, Great staff. Heavenly atmosphere, Great architecture!!!",Positive
"Though we booked a triple room, after they accompanied us to the room they have not arranged it as a triple room. After half an hour they arranged the bed but not others. We had to asked separately mug, glass, towel, etc. each and every time we need same. They informed us that the room was ready when we were at our lunch table. They have to check everything before informing us since we didn't even rush them.",Negative
Heritance Kandalama must be renovated.,Negative
"The only inland resort hotel in the work of Sri Lanka's leading architect Geoffrey Bawa. The rocky mountain and jungle in the background are integrated, and rocks are boldly incorporated into the lobby. The infinity pool, which is said to have been invented by Bawa, melts into the Kandalamana lake in front. Over there you can see Sigiriya Rock and Pidurangala Rock. The lake view room is a bright room where not only the bedroom but also the bathroom is glass to the ceiling. However, since it was built 30 years ago, it cannot be denied that the facilities are old and inconvenient. Since it is far from the city, naturally we will use the restaurant in the hotel for three meals. The breakfast and dinner buffets, as well as the lunch prefix course, have a wide variety of menus, so it seems that there will be no problem even if you stay for several nights. The price is very reasonable and I am happy. Beginning with a welcome drink, traditional musical instruments played by the pool at sunset, the luxurious and elaborate interior, and the wild monkeys everywhere, there is hospitality that can only be found here in both hard and soft aspects.",Positive
"Beautiful hotel in a wonderful location. The buffet was very good, and I loved the food. However, the superior rooms were smaller than what I expected. I recommend choosing rooms above the superior level. There are plenty of places for sightseeing in and around the hotel, and the service was good. The pool is also great. An excellent place to stay for nature lovers.",Positive
Excellent location with breath taking views. Food was divine and staff was very polite and attentive. Highly recommended,Positive
FANTASTIC STAY. THANK YOU BAWA. THANK YOU ALL FANTASTIC STAFF AT HERITANCE ü§ç,Positive
"The five-star hotel in the forest is also built on the mountain, without excessive excavation and development, and the water and soil are kept natural and green. The service is in place.",Positive
"An amazing stay ! Friendly staff, top notch amenities and breathtaking views. 11/10 recommended.",Positive
"Geoffrey Bawa architecture, a hotel with the concept of being one with nature. The building itself is 1km long. As expected of Bawa, no matter where you cut it, it will be a picture. There is the famous original infinity pool and two other pools where you can swim in nature.
Breakfast and dinner are buffets, and lunch is course only. The restaurant is very good value for a hotel of this level. Fresh vegetables are especially delicious at the buffet. Sri Lankan cuisine also tastes good, but some people may not enjoy it because there are many spicy menus.
The room is large and comfortable. It's fairly old, so I feel a little aging around the water such as the jacuzzi. There are few outlets, and Japanese products require conversion plugs. Digital detox recommended.",Positive
"An architecturally designed  excellent hotel  hidden among trees with a panoramic view over the Kandalama lake, coupled with excellent food and friendly staff",Positive
"Excellent hotel. But it is worth remembering that there are differences between European and Asian hotels. This gives a certain charm and charm, oriental flavor. Pleasantly surprised that the room is cleaned twice a day. The rooms are clean and free of insects. Read reviews about tired rooms. It is and is not at the same time. Due to high humidity and temperature, the external gloss is quickly lost. However, the service, food, breakfasts and dinners are just great. Cappuccino like in the best coffee houses of an old woman in Europe or St. Petersburg. Here everything is very leisurely and relaxing. Complete unity with nature. There is nothing nearby, so take breakfast and dinner, definitely. With quite a wealth of travel experience, this is the first hotel that blends so closely with nature.",Positive
"Beautiful hotel with an original design solution. Fairly spacious room. Clean bathroom. There is air conditioning, safe, refrigerator. Varied and delicious breakfast and dinner.
Several beautifully designed outdoor pools.
Expensive wine in the hotel restaurant.",Positive

"We spent our honeymoon at HK 9 years ago, and returned this past Jan. This place never disappoints.

The ambience and the food are incredible, but what makes HK so magical is the wonderful staff, who go out of their way to ensure you have an unforgettable experience.

This time round, we met Chef Dinesh  who encouraged us to tell him what dishes we wanted to learn to make, and his team would teach us. We selected a few dishes we'd already had at HK, and a couple at random.

Dinesh gave us a tour of the expansive kitchen, introduced us to some of the staff, and showed us how to make some of our favourite dishes. Months later, we've mastered his teachings, reliving at home (the best we can) the romance and magic of HK. Thanks Dinesh.

Tranquil, full of character, warmth, and hospitality; this is easily one of our favourite hotels ever visited - and we'll be back again and again, for a truly timeless experience.",Positive
"After 7 full nights in a full economy suite. In experience it is like that. There is no doubt that the hotel is located in a breathtaking landscape and in terms of architectural structure it is adapted within nature and that is special. All this goodness is pleasant when the hotel is not full of families with noisy children and thus loses all the peace and pastoral. One of the most disappointing things when you buy accommodation on a full economy basis is that they ask you to buy water with meals....what happens??? Anything else you order is overpriced. why and why In addition, the cleanliness is lacking and not clean. At the reception they will serve you a glass with a fruit cocktail but during your stay they will tell you that it is only for a reception...insulting. The staff is nice and helpful, all in all a pleasant and pampering experience",Negative
What a beautiful location and the service is second to none..amazing spa treatments as well.. I'd prefer they upgrade their electic socket system though..it was bit difficult as the socket was not near the bed..nevertheless what an amazing experience..if you are not a nature lover not the ideal place though..,Positive
"It's just feels like heaven with all the greenery surrounding, wide choice of food and very nice people working there.",Positive
"Me and our guests were treated rudely and unprofessionally by your staff at the buffet and check out!
Firstly after dinner the waiters ganged on us saying unprofessionally to sign the dinner invoices for each of us!
Secondly at check out we had paid our bills and there was a guest who was not in our group! The receptionist informed rudely that there is an unpaid bill, which was not our fault!",Negative
"Located in a beautiful environment, Kandalma Hotel is one of the most popular hotels in Sri Lanka.  Kandalma is a beautiful accommodation where Geoffrey Bawa's architecture and nature blend together.  A must-choose place for your vacation. Don't forget to experience a Sri Lankan safari and climb the World Heritage Sigiriya Rock.",Positive
"The meals are variety of flavorful choices & very tasty .
The room , bathroom was wonderful, clean, and perfect to spend holidays .",Positive
"We stayed one night at the Heritance Kandalama after our trip to Kandy and before going to visit Sigiriya Rock. Overall, a mixed experience. The location is excellent, with an infinity pool and breakfast area overlooking the lake. Excellent service from Akila, the pool attendant who took amazing pictures of us. Service from the restaurant was good. A big shout out to Dinesh for going out of his way to accommodate our vegetarian requirements. Reception staff was very poor though. We took a room on a full board rate, which we paid at check-in bur didn't get an invoice or any details on how they got to the rate. Late at night they called to say it was an incorrect rate and we had to pay more and we said we would at check-out. Next day after visiting Sigiriya whilst having lunch they came to us saying we had to pay more. We had to say please let us finish lunch and we will pay at check-out. When we went to pay, despite admitting fault they still said we had to pay. Had I known that the full board rate was basically a $30 for lunch and $35 for dinner, per person, I would have definitely refused. There were plenty of vegetarian options but the sri lankan food was too spicy and the western food left much to be desired. I would recommend the hotel for its location but nothing else. And definitely don't take full.board option is you are vegetarian. Staff need proper training.",Positive
Amazing üëè Place,Positive
"As a hotel owner myself, it is always difficult for me to write negatively about another accommodation. I am fully aware of the impact of this, and of the challenges that the hospitality industry has faced during the pandemic, and I am empathetic towards other business owners in this industry. However, I reluctantly feel compelled to share my disappointment with my current experience Heritance Kandalama, Sigiriya directly from the property.

Upon check-in, my partner and I were informed that there had been an error on our booking meaning the room had been booked for one guest only, despite booking a Deluxe Room and mailing the property ahead of time requesting 2 Twin beds. The hotel admitted no responsibility for this miscommunication and had zero empathy, I was quite upset although I was understanding that a solution must be found. Imagine my surprise when the hotel representative then demanded an additional $100 per night ($200 in total - essentially the cost of a second room), despite no further consumables being used for 2pax than there is for 1pax - bearing in mind this is on a ROOM ONLY basis. The room was prepared, and adding a second person to a room has zero impact on the hotels expenses from my first hand experience - especially as breakfast was not included. This blatant attempt at a money grab left a sour taste in our mouths, and we were disappointed by the lack of explanation provided and the antagonistic & disingenuous attitude of the front desk staff & front desk manager.

Upon reaching our room, we were greeted with a disturbing sight. A gigantic millipede and an ant infestation greeted us as soon as we entered. While we understood that we were in a jungle setting, we had expected a '5-star' property to be able to keep simple pests at bay.

In addition to this, the air conditioning unit in our room began to leak at 23:00 hours, causing the wooden floors to become flooded within just a few minutes. Despite multiple calls to the front desk requesting maintenance assistance, we were met with reluctance and had to call a second time to beg for someone to come to our room to fix the issue. This is not what I expect from any hotel - 1 star or 5 star. This is another example that showed a distinct lack of customer service.

On the second day of our stay, the lady from the first dispute displayed an attitude that was sour and unwelcoming. She did not greet us, nor did she smile or offer any form of service. This was incredibly disappointing and did nothing to improve our experience. This lack of interaction was the final straw that led me to publish this review, as I had initially wanted to move past the experience and simply see the previous days check-in as a one off.

However, it is worth noting that the restaurant staff were a bright spot during our stay. The restaurant manager was particularly kind and accommodating, and we thoroughly enjoyed the music provided by the flutist. We urge any future guests who do decide to choose to stay at this 'hotel' to sit outside whenever possible, as the atmosphere inside the dining hall is lacking and uninviting.

I hope the hotel takes this as constructive criticism and sees it as an opportunity to allow for leniency when it comes to human error, such as their own booking department's failure to pick up on a key detail prior to guest arrival. It would also be beneficial for the staff to receive training on how to manage expectations & dealing with mishaps. However, I fear that this feedback may not make an ounce of difference, given that there was the opportunity to make things right at the time. This is why I felt compelled to write this review.

In closing: the hotel may attempt to claim that we were given an upgrade due to our distress, but upon walking to our room, the front desk attendant revealed that we had already been upgraded before our incident. This leads us to believe that the hotel wanted to charge the second guest an inflated room rate based on this involuntary upgrade.",Positive
"everything's amazing.
definitely no.1 hotel all over the world.",Positive
Very beautiful and love the way it connects and blend with nature,Positive
Most beutyfull & amazing hotel,Positive
"We had a wonderful stay at Hotel Heritance Kandalama. The hotel is a masterpiece of architecture by Jeffry Bawa, blending harmoniously with the natural surroundings of forest, lake and rock. The hotel offers panoramic views of the Sigiriya Rocks, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and exotic activities like bird watching, lake safaris and cycling excursions. The service was impeccable, from the friendly staff to the delicious food. The rooms were spacious and comfortable, with oversize glass walls that let in plenty of natural light. The hotel also has three impressive pools and a divine spa that offer relaxation and rejuvenation. The only downside was that we had to wait more than an hour to check in due to high occupancy, but they compensated us by letting us check out late on the next day. Overall, I would highly recommend Hotel Heritance Kandalama for anyone looking for a tranquil retreat blessed by nature and design  .",Positive
"We had a great time during our stay. it was fabulous experience. Food was amazing, staff was so friendly.  overall it was unforgettable grate experience to our life.",Positive
"You need to go here for a reboot, at least for a few days, preferably without children, otherwise you may not catch the vibe of this place. The hotel is very large, integrated into the surrounding landscape, many interesting locations visually and just for meditation. The abundance of flora and fauna is like in a hotel: opening the window you can see a monkey, and walking along the hall you can meet flying foxes and butterflies; as well as beyond. You can also see elephants.",Positive
We stayed 2 nights at Kandalama. Best location with lots of monkeys in the forest,Positive
"Yes,It's very nice place. Specially the view with bushes and the lake.
We enjoyed well..
I love this place.",Positive
We actually dropped by for lunch because their food is amazing.  Unfortunately they didn't have the buffet but they did have an impressive set menu.  As always their service and food was wonderful,Positive
A wonderful hotel in harmony with nature.,Positive
"They will basically hold you hostage, won‚Äôt let you get a normal taxi, will make you pay an arm and a leg for a car to get out of the hotel.

The hotel at night is basically an old folks home.

Be prepared to be woken up by screaming children at 7am. EVERYDAY!

Any tours you do will be extortionate.

The pools close super early (8pm)

Basically, if you‚Äôre a young and fun person this hotel is not for you. This hotel is for retired people.",Negative

What an amazing design by Geoffrey Bawa. Great staff. Pool is wonderful. Meals are great. Don‚Äôt miss the musician by the pool every evening.,Positive

"Beautiful hotel in the heart of the jungle, the jacuzzi bath in the rooms onlooking the jungle is sensational",Positive
"Highly recommended!!
I had a wonderful time during the two nights I spent here at Kandalama with my family. The location and the ambience of the hotel is such that you can spend the entire time of your trip at the hotel enjoying their numerous pools and the natural beauty. The staff is highly customer oriented and attentive to our needs. And the food, simply exquisite!! The buffet offers a wide range of choice too.
Worth visiting over and over again.",Positive
One of the best hotel in Sri Lanka. Its architecture is truly magnificent. Hotel Staff also really friendly.,Positive
"Hotel location is great and the pools are beautiful, food was average, we booked it via Agoda, check in was delayed, kept the kids waiting for hours- they were focused on money only! Service at restaurant could have been better.",Positive
There's nothing to complain about than the sneaky monkeys.  Amazing experience. Staff and service was on point and above.,Positive
We only spent the weekend at the hotel but ooooff! The whole hotel with the incredible architecture from Late Mr. Bawa was just soo amazing! Loved every bit of it .. Additionally the range of food!

"We went for high-tea. Before serve, they have confirmed its charge for platters. Not for pax count. We have got the confirmation from two officials.

Unfortunately once we take High tea, they are charging for head count. Worthless . Totally disappointed about their bad communication and pricing",Negative
nice hotel,Positive
"This hotel is an amazing piece of architecture, and seeing it in person is a unique experience. It's located in the middle of a jungle surrounded by a lake, which is very beautiful. The hotel itself has all the features you'd expect, and they're all very nicely done. There's a gorgeous infinity pool, and the food is great - they have both international and local dishes available in the buffet. The service is also very warm and friendly. Overall, I highly recommend visiting this hotel in Sri Lanka. It's a must-see!",Positive
"Visited as one night of our honeymoon.
The hotel blended into the forest and was very quiet and relaxing.
Hotel staff are also very friendly and helpful.
There were a lot of monkeys, and it was very cute to see them coming to peek outside the room.",Positive

"We have just returned from our honeymoon at Heritence Kandalama
What an absolutely stunning place, from the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty.

All of the staff from waiters, bar staff, chefs and housekeeping are truly amazing and the friendliest staff we have ever encountered, they really do make your stay that extra special.
The food was amazing, and the restaurant location is stunning overlooking the lake.
Big shout out to the manager who even opened the gift shop for us on our last day as we had to leave early.
The sights and sounds of this stunning hotel will stay with is forever, it is simply an amazing place.
We will definitely return.
Mark and Wendy Allan",Positive
"The hotel is in harmony with the environment, and the building is built to match the natural environment. The swimming pool and the reservoir are separated by a line, and the water and the sky are the same color. Take a break to cool off the summer heat naturally.",Positive

"2018

Exquisitely elegance place!

It has been more closer to nature than years ago that we used to go there. Naturally cool, calm, and playful ambiance give you physical, emotional, and spiritual healing that you needed the most.

"the location is great, in the middle of the jungle, nice rooms maybe a bit old, but ok. Cheeky monkeys are everywhere, especially on the room balconies. Be careful, lock it, otherwise you'll get in! Great food and very very nice staff! Special thanks to Dimuth in the restaurant!",Positive
Wonderful location.very professional staff.rooms r cleaned with amazing views,Positive

Stunning hotel nestled within the jungle and natural landscape! The rooms are little awkwardly laidout but I guess thats cause the hotel is built into the rocks with minimal disruption. Food is delicious. Watchout for wildlife.,Positive
Excellent,Positive
One of the best hotels in Sri Lanka,Positive
We can call it wonders of the world hotel. A six stories hotel bonded tour natural rock mountain created by world's best architect late Mr Jeffrey Bava if you Google you will find his creations. Being a pilot I don't see this hotel at hawk eye view as the hotel is bonded to The jungle and absorbed to the earth I should say very few is kind of hotels in the world that you should visit and experience. It's my first time but I will never forget to my life and must visit again and again. Wild animals are always  neighbors on the doors and windows. That is one of the specialty when you live in the jungle and it is safe.,Positive
Beautiful place,Positive
Hotel is one of the oldest with a beautiful architecture located facing the Kandalama lake. The way the hotel is maintained without disrupting the wildlife is highly appreciated. We visit there just after our wedding and we spent smooth stay at there. Staff was very friendly and Helpful. Food is excellent.,Positive
"I recently had the opportunity to visit a hotel with my partner during a quieter period. The hotel is situated in a stunning location, next to the beautiful Kandalama lake. The hotel boasts three swimming pools, although due to the lower occupancy, only two were in operation during our stay. Food was delicious and offered a variety of options. We opted for a deluxe room with a jacuzzi, and were treated to breathtaking views of the sunrise. While the room was a bit smaller than what one may expect in similar hotels, it was well-appointed and comfortable. The hotel's commitment to preserving the environment is evident in the beautiful greenery and trees that surround the premises, and the playful monkeys that roam freely. The staff was highly accommodating and displayed excellent customer service, making our experience enjoyable. In conclusion, I would highly recommend this hotel as a good place to visit for a relaxing getaway.",Positive
"It was an awesome experience and we had a good time there.A must visit location in the beautiful Island SriLanka.

Special thanks to Mr.Asela (GM) and his team (Mr.Lalith/Mr.Sanath/Ms.Imali)
They have treated us really and very friendly staff.

Highly Recommended for both local and Foreign tourists.

-Cheers-",Positive
Excellent customer care. Highly appreciate the friendliness of the staff.,Positive
"This is one the most iconic hotels in Sri Lanka, situated at the center of the island aboding a beautiful lake. The design and construction of the hotel is done by blending and harmonizing with Elements of nature. its one of greenest hotels we have visited, The view above the Kandalama lake is priceless. This is a 5 star property and has many luxurious villas and rooms with great amenties and sevices. The staff is very friendly ans attentive. Its was great experience overall.",Positive
"We Stayed at Heritance Kandalama for 2 nights, Stay was simply remarkable, Loved the architecture it was so green, and mesmerizing view, The nature lovers and those who live a stressful life, this is a great place to relax with loved ones. The room was so clean, we got the deluxe room with the jacuzzi. We could see the sunrise and Sigiriya rock from our room, which was a beautiful scene. Super Friendly Staff with a warm welcome at the reception. The food is also delicious and excellent and it was nice to see that chef speaking to guests personally. and also all the restaurant staff was friendly. &#13;&#10;Overall it‚Äôs an amazing experience! Looking forward to coming again :)",Positive
"The surrounding area and the hotel premises look very lovely and pleasant. It is undeniably a great work of architecture! But the only downside is the service that they provide. I went there over the weekend, and it took more than an hour to check us in to the hotel. We were waiting in the lobby area, frustrated. And the reason they gave is that the day is busy, and clearly, I saw a lack of service staff in the lobby/reception area. Visitors might travel from far away with the intention of checking in quickly and having a rest, but this gave me more stress than I expected. Sad to say, the unsatisfactory service experience continues in Bar as well. In the evening (before dinner), we ordered a few drinks and snacks, but it took more than 40 minutes to serve us the snacks that we ordered. I was amazed at the fact that they take this much time to serve their customers, and I had to cancel it to go to dinner. However, the staff at the buffet/restaurant are outstanding! They are very quick and friendly. The food is very tasty, and the variety of food is also very good. Rooms are clean and tidy. The surrounding area is also very clean and pleasant. I wish they would fix their issues in terms of service in those areas; otherwise, it will give a bad impression that will last forever! ... Due to poor customer service, I felt the value for money was not met.",Positive
Everytime I have visited it has been an amazing memorable stay. Love the architecture which prioritises nature and conservation. Amazing service as always.,Positive
"Eco-freindly resort hotel inside wood area, view from the room lookin down lake is just fantastic. Looking out the lake in the jacuzzi or in the pool is unforgettable experience. Service and food were also great. Only limitation about the resort is the location, which itself is great but not easy to get there.",Positive
"If you are a nature lover, this is one of the best places to visit in sri lanka. Had a great vacation, thanks to the friendly and helpful staff.  Will definitely visit again.",Positive
I wish this remained a bucket list item that wasn't ticked off. We had a very disappointing stay. The room we stayed didn't have good air conditioning. Didn't want to make a fuzz because we stayed only one night. However the staff and other facilities were good. Hopefully this hotel will fully gain its glory once tourism kicks off and the place gets maintained regularly. An amazing place to visit though at least only for the location.,Negative
Beautiful place,Positive
"The architecture is awesome. Well done Jeffrey Bawa.
The view is awesome.
The service is Good
But the quality of the food is not up to the standards of a 5-star hotel and needs improvement (some 4-star hotels have better food).
The eco-park needs improvement, the naturalists there are great though.",Positive
"An amazing experience turned sour at the check out!

My family and I checked in to Herittance Kandalama for just one night, the overall experience was amazing until we checked out and went into cashier's office to make payments.

My father made the booking via an individual by the name Indunil who works at your Hotel, he failed to communicate effectively the room rates to my father and we were in for a surprise when we checked out. Apparently we were upgraded to two suites rather than double rooms for which he sent the confirmation via whatsapp to my father. The front desk also failed to communicate this at the time of checkin and consequently we were requested to pay an extra 30,000 LKR at the end. I was absolutely furious as we were not made aware of this and a hotel of such caliber failed miserably to effectively communicate to their customer the room rates. We made the payment but left with a bitter taste.

The hotel also failed to provide my wife with a band aid, that's a very simple request which the hotel failed to cater to.

I would not recommend this property to my friendly and family as we felt we were deceived.",Positive
"We four of us, this is my wife and two daughters obviously including myself,  climbed Sigiriya in the morning and made our arrival  to Heritance thereafter. Had some excitement on our way to hotel as well by waiting  for an elephant to move freely across the road. He had his own time and freedom to cross while no disturbance from us except closely watching his movement and eye contacts. Then some Baboons gave us good time with  free entertainment.  We made the checking around 2.30pm and rocking environment along with fantastic view  and hospitality from staff made us to  leave the place with wonderful memories. Fingers cross for next visit. Thank you Heritance.",Positive
Amazing service friendly staff delicious food. Beautiful atmosphere. Definitely recommend this to everyone!!,Positive
One of very best and Ecofriendly hotels in Sri Lanka. A must visit place for everyone,Positive
"One of the best green hotels in Sri Lanka. Situated just above the Kandalama lake facing Sigiriya and Dambulla. Great hospitality, delicious buffet and awsome scenaries.",Positive
A very special hotel which I will not forget. Integrated into the nature so you can be part of it! The staff is very friendly and always helpful. Special thanks to Indunil who has organized a mind blowing dinner for us!,Positive
"This hotel is one of the oldest with a beautiful architecture located facing the Kandalama lake. The way the hotel is maintained without disrupting the wildlife is highly appreciated.
Staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. Our favorite part was the buffet which included a variety of active stations both for dinner and breakfast (we stayed during a long weekend so the spread was huge)
Rooms were quite old but was spacious.
Definitely worth the visit ‚ú®",Positive
"By far the best hotel i have been 2, the staff are very respectful, rooms are well cleaned, the food is amazing and the hotel is huge with 6 floors and free wifi. Very excited to go there again this year.",Positive
"Beautiful hotel, amazing staff and service! Highly recommend!",Positive
Excellent hotel and the staff,Positive
"Had an amazing experience at this fantastic hotel. Situated in a superb location with great views all around, somewhat old but luxurious and very comfortable rooms, tasty buffet with a large spread of options where you can eat your fill.. a definite recommendation as a must visit place in Sri Lanka..",Positive
Just wow..... nature lover's...,Positive
Magnificent hotel nestled in the middle of nature but marred by a tourist factory. More privacy would have made the experience unique and there are not enough deckchairs to enjoy the pool!,Positive
Love that place much,Positive
"This hotel is worried about the oldness of the elevator and the water area, but the others are wonderful.",Positive
The most spectacular hotels in Sri Lanka. Just amazing!!,Positive
Best place to spend your holiday . Best Foods,Positive
Fantastic - this architect's favorite building in the whole world. (Even if it's made of concrete),Positive
"Really unique hotel which was designed by jeffrey bawa located in the forrest and designed to allow nature run through with minimal intervention. You can actually see monkeys outside the balcony of your room (warning though keep the doors locked as they come looking for food).

Food in the buffet is so so - generally there are one or two items which are really really good and the rest are typical buffet food.

Small bar and very isolated and private (far away from the main road).

Has two swimming pools, small bar area, table tennis court and meeting / function halls.

Truly a unique stay.

Easily can visit sigiriya and dambulla temple (town is not far at all).

Has an elephant safari as well (go for the eco one vs the rest more reasonably priced!).",Positive
"This is an amazing hotel with outstanding customer service on all aspects ! The staff is friendly , the hotel is very clean, the food is delicious and there is an overall upscale feel to it! They have maintained the hotel with minimum damage to the natural environment , great outdoor pool with great looks of kandalama lake amenities and also a nice gym.

Most of the times it's full of tourists because of Lion Rock SIGIRIYA and natural environment of this area. It's good for safari facilities and many

It's very good and recommended for anyone.

It's located near the distance of the world heritage site Lion Rock SIGIRIYA of Sir Lankan.",Positive
"Definitely should be on your top 3 places to stay in while in Sri Lanka. Set in a jungle with a lake on one side. Approx 4hrs from Colombo. Have stayed here a few times over the years, still love it every time I go. Quite a relaxing place. Minimum 2 nights recommended as you can actually unwind. I stayed for 4 days/3 nights.",Positive

"It was an excellent stay there at the Heritance Kandalama.  The naturalist, Mr. Nalinda Samaranayaka explained so many things about wildlife.  Very interesting trip.",Positive
It was a great experience,Positive
Visited for lunch. 13600 for 2 persons. Includes a cafe on the first floor. It seemed that there were not many foreign tourists.,Negative
"My recent experience at Heritance Kandalama was very disappointing.

To begin with, we've reserved for a panoramic view room and as per the description on their website the room offers a panoramic view of the kandalama lake and the dambulla rock. Whereas; our room's view was obstructed by the trees so barely had the said view. I brought this into the staffs attention and their response was they do not cut tress and the website still contains old pictures. They were not ready to relocate us to a better room either. So beware: the pictures are deceiving and you wouldn't get a solution for your concerns from the staff. We have paid for a view that was existed many years ago.

The washroom badly needs a renovation. We expected a better quality washroom for the amount of money we paid.

Eventhough there is a narrow balcony we couldn't use it as the monkeys intrude each time you open the door and step out to get some fresh air. We were wondering why couldn't the hotel use a detachable fence or a net that will allow the guests to use the balcony for the amount of money they pay.

Finally we requested for a late checkout as we were on full board and the front desk rejected it without hesitation.

Utter waste of money and I regret for choosing this hotel when there are plenty of good places around sigiriya and dambulla to choose. Do not deserve to be called a 5 star hotel anymore.",Negative
We had a very enjoyable stay in Kandalama for 2 nights and 3 days over christmas. The christmas eve gala dinner was exceptional with amazing decoration and a wide variety of food. The rooms were beautiful and well furnished and the location of the hotel is stunning. The staff were all approachable and helpful. We especially want to thank Mr Nimantha and Chef Madushanka for their exceptional service and making our vacation that much better.,Positive
The staff were all excellent and accomidating the food was fantastic and the hotel itself with its rich jungle surroundings was truly beautiful. I would highly recommend this to anyone visiting sri lanka,Positive
Excellent stay over the Christmas Weekend and the hospitality extended was superb.,Positive
Amazing hotel with beautiful nature around lot of monkey nice breakfast and good service,Positive
"The hotel was beautiful, restaurant staff was friendly but we had some problem with the booking and the rooms provided for us. First of all when we booked the rooms, we were only told it would be a double and triple superior, no other information was provided (view, which wing). Since this was our first time we didn't really ask for more information either. That maybe our fault I admit. However, for what we paid, we weren't fairly compensated for the rooms. 1) both the rooms were facing a car park. When we inquired about this we were told, for better views we had to pay more- which is fine but it's the hotels responsibility to inform us when we made the reservation. 2) both rooms the curtains were super dirty. They had huge black and brown stains. It looked like the curtains weren't washed in years. 3) the triple room the AC was leaking. Someone came to fix it but no one arrived to clean the mess despite informing the front desk. 4) the overall dismissive nature of the front desk staff about the complaints 5) the double room phone wasnt working. All in all it was quite apparent they had put us up in two run down rooms. I'm not sure if we were offered a lower price for the run down rooms or we paid the usual rates but were put up in run down rooms (I do think it's the latter). This was our experience and it wasn't a great one.",Positive
Amazing hotel! Not a complain on anything.,Positive
Highly recommended,Positive
I spent a weekend with few of my family members. We were warmly welcomed and staff were doing an amazing job even though a large number of guests were checking in at the same time. Rooms were clean and well maintained. The location of the hotel is very beautiful and it is mesmerizing how it has been built doing minimal damage to the natural environment. Food was exceptional and there were many options to choose from. You can engage in several kinds of activities such as bird watching at the the Kandalama rereservoir . The total experience is wonderful.,Positive
"Nature lovers should definitely try this. View from each an every corner of the hote is breathtaking.
The rooms were clean, very comfortable, and the staff was incredibly friendly, helpful. Food is delicious!

"Disgusting service: on booking / and on a call they reported one price, upon arrival the price tripled. As soon as they refused, the manager dropped the price to the one that was announced when calling.

Some kind of scam, as if managers put it in their pocket. By the way, the photo does not correspond to reality. The hotel is not in the best condition",Negative
"Amazing experience , the hotel has is sorunded by the jungle and you feel the jungle has emerced with the hotel.  The morning and evening views of the lake are just jaw dropping and peaceful.  Lots of wild life.  Be aware of the monkeys as they are smart and will take any chance to grab some food from the rooms if unattended.",Positive

"A short review of our two-day stay at The Heritance Kandalama. Overall stay was fantastic. It was one of the best hotel experiences I had in Sri Lanka.

I must highlight these individual staff members that helped us during our stay with exceptional service.
Executive Chef - Chef Nalinda was very kind to prepare delicious food for our kids. I can't imagine that he made a 'Sri Lankan style - fish egg stir fry'' on top of what we were enjoying at the restaurant buffet. He was kind enough to share his passion for food and a tour of the kitchen. I admire his hard work in promoting Sri Lanka tourism. We had most of our meals at the main restaurant. Their food was fresh and well put together. The staff always checked with us on the feedback on food and service. They tried to accommodate us with a suitable table for our kids so that they felt comfortable.

Hotel Operations - Mr. Lalith went the extra mile to make sure we enjoyed our stay. From the room amenities to room service, we experienced top-class service from his team.

Hotel General Manager - We had a chance to meet Mr. Gamini a couple of times. He was making sure that we were given the best service from his team.

Overall, I would like to take this opportunity to thank The Heritance Kandalama team for making our two-day stay very enjoyable with your beautiful smiles.",Positive
Nice hotel.went for a business award function.beautiful.,Positive
"Went there last weekend for the annual office trip. Welcomed us warmly with a flower. Staff was very friendly and polite. Had good service. Rooms were of good quality. View from balcony, inside room n even bathroom is great. The hotel is surrounded by lot of trees in and out which gives u a fresh feeling. Infinity pool , coco spa were great add ons . Boat ride in kandalama lake was also great.",Positive
"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay here - The ambience, food and staff were magnificent. We stayed in a room where the Jacuzzi is facing through the bushes and tress gave us a pleasant experience. A stay to remember!",Positive
"Amazing hotel to stay, immersed in nature, service is also great.",Positive
Had a wonderful time. Food was the top pick which was marvelous.,Positive
I stay two nights with family.good place for holiday to get relax from busy environment.,Positive
"We spent one night during our vacation in Sri Lanka. Heritance Kandalama had a wonderful buffet. Foods were tasty and had many varieties. Rooms were small and not updated, But it had a wonderful jungle view. There is a beautiful lake view from the pool. If you are lucky, you will see wild elephants too.",Positive
"Check in and check out works great.
Rooms are very clean and nicely furnished. Great balcony with a view of the lake and a large whirlpool tub
Food is top class in the mornings and evenings
The buffet is complemented by cooking stations... Selection and quality are top and the service top
The infinity pool is great too with a great view over the lake
The bar offers a good selection and the cocktails are well mixed
The only thing that is annoying is that the staff starts cleaning up at 9 p.m. and you want to enjoy the evening atmosphere yourself
All in all a great facility",Positive
Awesome ‚ô•Ô∏è,Positive
"Beautiful location, warm and welcoming staff and the most delicious food you‚Äôll ever eat in Dambulla!
We decided to stop at Kandalama Hotel for lunch on a whim. We were pleasantly surprised to find a whole entourage waiting to greet us at the entrance- Mr Asela the GM and Mr Lalith, who has been working here since the hotel was built, and the wonderful staff immediately made us feel like we were at home. We were given a cool towel and a choice of fresh juice to refresh ourselves upon arrival. Lunch was served √† la carte at the restaurant, which is set against the backdrop of a large igneous rock cave. Mr Asela was kind enough to give us a tour as well as the history behind the hotel. The structure is truly hiding in plain sight amongst the vast jungle and shrubbery, and the I appreciate the architecture which has been designed with minimal damage to the natural surroundings and formations. After a formidable meal, we left the hotel to go on safari (again arranged for us by the staff) and decided to come back for dinner. We again felt nothing short of welcomed. I recommend this hotel to anyone planning on staying in Dambulla. It has no shortcomings and its people are the friendliest you‚Äôll ever meet around here.",Positive
Heritance Kandalama is one of the nice and cool hotels in Kandalama. Friendly staff.,Positive
"We visited hotel for our anniversary in the month of november.we stayed for 3 days,right from beginning till end everything was good and amazing with delicious food and extraordinary nature's touch.

All three meals were buffet and there were varieties of food , even the arrangement of the buffet was pretty cool. The staff and the place everything was too good. The speciality of heritance is the surrounding which is full of trees and gives a feeling like we are amidst the jungle. Good place to visit.",Positive

The stay at Heritance - Kandalama is undoubtedly the best experience we have had as a family so far. The location is excellent, rooms are spotless , the meals served are delicious and plentiful. The staff were very friendly , caring and accommodated all our requests and made our stay very memorable.
The live music ( flute and sitar) arranged in the evening was a pleasant surprise and we thoroughly enjoyed it.

Tranqulity and elegance at it's best ! The unique architectural design of Jeffrey Bava, closeness to the nature offered us an unforgettable experience.The room had a stunning view and the room was in immaculate condition
We would definitely go back again.
Would appreciate if reception answer calls , as during our stay it was hard to connet to front office.",Positive
"2 stars are only give for the very kind and attentive staff and natural views.
The rest of the hotel and the rooms are in a very poor conditions and thoroughly in need of an upgrade/refurbishment, you can tell this place hasn‚Äôt been touched since it opened decades ago.
The state of the bathrooms are the worse, cracked sinks, rusting taps and showers. Shower doors don‚Äôt shut properly so it leaks all on the bathroom floor. Black toilet. The views are meant to sell this property, but I‚Äôm not sure the last time the windows in the rooms, bathrooms and or in the restaurant were cleaned- surely these should be done regularly to make the most of the views??
The food in the restaurant is pretty terrible too, uncooked potato‚Äôs, lack of flavour in the food- we all struggled to eat for 3 days.
If you are staying here note that there is little/nothing around it unless you travel.
Overall- in desperate need a refurbishment, not 5 star standard at all. I wouldn‚Äôt stay here again.",Negative
One of the most renowned hotels in Sri Lanka for it's unique design to blend in to the Jungle. We stayed in a suite which was spacious and we had nothing to complain as we loved every minute of our stay. However some rooms types may be relatively smaller. Fabulous views of the Kandalama lake and jungle is something to cherish. Service is superb with great attention to each guest. Food was excellent. A Gym and a Spa is also there.,Positive
"Amazing experience, Rooms are quite spacious and beautiful. Beware of Monkeys. Don't open balcony doors unless you want to get robbed.

Buffet variety was not up to Kandalama standards.",Positive
Super...!!!,Positive

"We stayed at Heritance Kandalama during our recent trip to Sri Lanka in September 2022. It was the best memory of Sri Lankan trip to my two young children. The natural hideout nestled  in the nature with breathtaking views of Kandalama lake and Sigiriya rock, abundant natural wildlife, scrumptious food, fantastic guest services with authentic Sri Lankan hospitality, honestly we couldn't have asked more. As my wife and me had stayed in the hotel previously, we knew it would be amazing. It was heartening to see that everything we described to our two young children before the trip about Sri Lankan hospitality, beauty and the Kandalama hotel they were able to experience.  Thank you Priya and your entire team, particularly Padmini of the Guest Shop for your great service with a real human touch. Also Sarath from concierge team, the pool attendant are also awesome. Also would like to thank Ajantha Jayasinghe of Aitken Spence Hotel Management.
We are very much looking forward to staying with you on our next Sri Lankan trip. Greetings from Canberra, Australia.",Positive
"Sometimes
we just need to take

ourselves.

This is one of the best hotels I've ever seen. It's one of the grandest hotels in the middle of the jungle üòçü•∞",Positive
Exceptional experience in this secluded jungle covered resort designed by legendary sri lankan Architect Mr Geoffrey Bawa. This is one of the greatest experiences  one can have in sri lanka. The service  is beyond exceptional and the location is out of this world.  Its an extra dimensional feeling. If you are visiting  this place remember  this is an old hotel build as a first of its kind in this country thus the amenities and fittings may look a bit old. This amplifies  the mixture of minimalism and tropical modernism embedded in this masterpiece.  There is a unique atmosphere that transforms the environment and takes you to the true essence of this culture and civilisation just by being in this creation. A true architectural masterpiece.,Positive
"Beautiful hotel.good place to visit in spare time.It has beautiful views ,excellent foods ,hotel staff are very curtious and helpful . Heritance Kandalama is one of the best hotel in Sri Lanka.",Positive
"Heritance Kandalama‚Äîwithout a doubt‚Äîis one of the finest hotels in Sri Lanka. Despite the tough economic climate in the country, this hotel maintains superior standards in terms of facilities, F&B, and customer service. The cozy panoramic rooms we booked offered great views of the magnificent Kandalama reservoir and the hotel arranged to have rooms interconnected, so we could move freely between rooms.

Though the reservoir steals the show, Geoffrey Bawa's exceptional architecture, Laki Senanayake's artistic talents and the way the hotel merges with nature are marvels in their own right.

Special shoutout to Yoshina for her infectious hospitality and to Shymie (from head office) for adjusting our reservation multiple times, patiently. We had warm interactions with everyone from reservations to check out.

Will be visiting again and highly recommend this gem of a hotel.",Positive
"Horrendous experience! My husband and I were travelling around Sri Lanka on our honeymoon in August and kandalama had to be on the list because of all the good memories but it's not the same kandalama we used to know!

HORRIBLE service - check in process took forever, staff was gloomy, and not helpful.

We wanted to extend our stay purely based on the beauty of the hotel and we were treated so poorly by the head receptionist who made very rude comments about us being locals when we were inquiring.

They've hired trainees from hotel schools who have not been trained properly by the managers at kandalama or given proper information. I don't blame the trainees as they were trying their best to fix the situation  after failing but the head receptionist (Prasanna - I might have the wrong name) was so rude to us we've never experienced such horrible service in our lives!

So sad to see one of our favourite resorts since childhood in such  poor state. I did not want to stay there a minute longer so we left and they tried to compensate by giving us some free jam on our way out ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

BOTTOM LINE - SPEND YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE",Negative
"Super friendly staff, specialy wait staff. Food is excellent with a wide range
Room quality can be improved though",Positive
"One of the Bawa's masterpieces with a very confusing floor structure...

We were there at Oct-2022 for two nights and we choose Deluxe King room at the Dambulla wing for our stay. The view from the room is astonishing surrounded by the trees and seeing the Sigiriya by the Kandalama reservoir. There are two wings to the hotel, name Sigiriya and Dambulla, where the views from both wings are just amazing. Both of these wings are connected through the floor 5, and the other floors are separately built for each wing on top of a huge rock. These both wings have separate gardens as well. The main restaurant which we had all 3 meals are sitting next a naturally formed cave, and also, they can arrange a cave dinner if we request it, which is reportedly cost around $400. The Dambulla wing has the Rashmi pool, but it was closed when we were there and the other two pools are located in the Sigiriya wing. We can access the Kandalama reservoir from a beautiful passage surrounded by trees where wild elephants and horses could roam. At the weekend they hosts different types of fun events like musical shows, violin plays, eastern orchestral band, art shows by shaping up ice, etc. The staff is very friendly and they have arranged a tuk-tuk from the outside for our departure as well.",Positive
"If you wish to relax your vacation. Highly recommended.
Inspired it.",Positive
"One of the best hotels in Sri Lanka, in the middle of nature (you can see the wild elephants coming to drink in the morning...it's amazing), excellent restaurant. Excellent value for money in 2016.",Positive
Wonderful experience . Staff serving towards guests were commendable . Large variance of buffet with quality taste.,Positive
"The way the hotel is maintained without disrupting the wildlife is highly appreciated. Staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. Food was delicious and Dimuth along with his team at the main restaurant has been very helpful and courteous. They arranged a very nice surprise for my mom's birthday on short notice. We've left the DSLR camera at the hostel by mistake and the staff were able to locate the owner and called within a few minutes of us leaving the hotel to inform the camera had been left behind.
Overall the stay has been enjoyable with the beautiful views and nature.
However the room size is very small compared to other hotels.",Positive
Every thing excellent except the spa is too tall to climb. Best food you will get for your money. Great overall experience!,Positive
"Overall it's a great hotel and really worth it if you go on a weekend. Weekdays there's no buffet and although there's a good enough A La Carte menu, the food is meh. Most of the A La Carte items we ordered didn't have the mentioned items/garnishes in them. But the portions were very big and filling (more than enough for 1 person).
The buffet on the other hand was way better. The varieties were endless and the food tasted really good. There was homemade butter and jams.

The rooms and the service were exceptional. The jacuzzi is awesome, rooms are spacious and have a view of the lake. The surroundings are also very beautiful and there are some awesome views. The hot air balloon ride wasn't available at the time we went though.

I'd highly recommend the place and even though we were kind of disappointed on the A La Carte menu on the first day, the buffet and the rooms more than made up for it on the next 2 days. It's awesome for couples and is very peaceful.",Positive
Splendid. Love this place and service.,Positive
Exceptional service provided by the staff! They were quick and attentive to all our requests! The hotel is well maintained and we loved our stay!,Positive
Good!!!!!!,Positive
"I stayed in Kandalama Hotel back in October 1st week, and even though the cost is slightly high compared to other hotels, I can confidently say this is the best hotel I stayed in Sri Lanka. Staff is very polite and supportive unlike many star classed hotels and you can get anything solved by talking to them. Environment is great and this is a architectural masterpiece located in a middle of jungle. Food is good, even though the many of the foods items mainly focused towards Sri lankan cuisines, the quality was great and taste was by far the best. On rainy days the path leading to the hotel might get muddy, other than that everything is great in this place.",Positive

"Stayed here for 4 night back in August. We were thoroughly impressed. Beautiful hotel, secluded and surrounded by nature. Pools were beautiful, gym was great. Staff were really friendly and attentive (a special thanks to the team turning down our room who made towel animals for us each day! They made us smile so much :) ) Food was brilliant, with a lot of choice. Epic views from our room.

"Stay at the masterpiece left by the world-famous Sri Lankan architect Geoffrey Bawa during his lifetime. The borrowed scenery from the rainforest and lakeside, the symbiosis with nature (there are many wild monkeys), the contrast of light and shadow, the boundless boundaries between inside and outside the site, and the hospitality of the workers were all wonderful.",Positive
An architectural masterpiece. You may have heard of it but to experience it is a different thing. A hotel built in alignment with nature in the midst of a jungle surrounded by a lake. Absolute beauty. The surrounding alone makes a visit worthy. All the other aspects expected in a hotel is ticked beautifuly. Beautiful infinity pool is a plus. Food is great. Service is warm. Absolute recommendation in every aspect.,Positive
"Beautiful environment inside and outside the hotel. Good food, friendly and helpful staff makes it really enjoyable to stay.",Positive
"We stayed 2 nights at the hotel . Really happy with the excellent service of the hotel staff Special Thanks to Trilishiya ,Rasika ,and all other staff take care of us during our stay .",Positive

Wonderful place to enjoy nature in a peaceful manner.,Positive
This is the best food so far! Huge variety of food üòç shared life with nature! Rooms are little old but good maintenance. Service it little rude. No flexibility from the staff.,Positive
"The hotel was great no question about it, The location the property is situated is awesome no matter which direction you look there is a beautiful view and the hotel itself is very beautiful. As for the rooms they were very nice very well maintained and very clean we booked 2 panoramic rooms and the views from the rooms were great. The property is very big it has a very modern gym with every machine imaginable, a badminton court, tennis court and a volleyball court and they do also provide bikes for cycling so not short of activities. The hotel staff is very friendly we troubled them with many requests and they helped us with a smile. The reason for only 4 stars is we checked in on a Thursday and apparently they only have buffets on Friday and the weekend, not that the set menu was bad but some food from the menu were not upto the 5 star standard ( for example the pizza as shown in the images below looks nice and also the toppings and the sauce were good but the crust was really hard), the discription in the menu and what they serve on the plate I can't say are the exact same and I feel like a hotel with a 5 star rating shouldn't have these issues but most of the food from the menu was very good and the buffet no complaints it was great. Overall had a very pleasant and relaxing experience. Up there as one of my top 3 hotels visited definitely will be visiting again. Oh and you should visit their spa very friendly people and you can get authentic Balinese massages from certified Indonesian masseuse and apparently the massages are very good according to my mother üòÖ.",Positive
"Inheritance Kandalama hotel is a great place to spend your vacation

Bad things/ improvements

2. No freely available square type plug in the room to charge mobile devices
3. There is no separate rain shower or tap in bathroom (we selected panaromic view type room)
4. This is a big hotel but no one will guide you (swimming pool locations, view points, garden areas)
5. They offer only 2L free water for two people. If you want more then you have to pay (personally I don't like this. Because Sri Lanka is rich in water)",Positive

Thank you to Chef Dinesh for organizing and to Chef Ravi and Chef Upul for the wisdom. We learnt a lot and felt cared for. We hope that tourism in Sri Lanka can be vibrant in these post pandemic times and that the locals can prosper. Many thanks, Janet",Positive
We just come to visit the hotel and it was just so amazing. The reception requested one of their guys to tour us around and see the wonderful interiors and views from 3rd to 7th floor. It was one mesmerizing visit to a wonderful place.,Positive
"The hotel stay was fabulous! The hotel is located by the lake, where animals come to drink. We saw a family of elephants. Incredible beauty of sunsets and sunrises! It feels like you are visiting nature itself! There are a lot of monkeys who don't touch people, but just live their lives. It's an indescribable feeling. The breakfasts are very tasty at the hotel. You can also order food at the restaurant, the prices are reasonable. Excellent, very attentive staff. There are two pools, one with a horizon going into the lake, the other is made in a natural style. I've never seen such beauty in my life! I didn't want to leave! I highly recommend at least a few days to immerse yourself in the atmosphere of this hotel. It will be remembered for a lifetime",Positive

The staff was extremely friendly, the restaurant very flexible (appreciate this!) and the restaurant staff deserves a special thanks. We had great evening with music here, which obviously also added up to the experience.

Excellent hotel with excellent location at Jungle, extremely clean & comfortable. Would definitely recommend this hotel to everybody!

Thank you again Heritance Kandalama for going just that little step extra for the guests!!!",Positive

Food, not so so much varieties, but decent and the ones available are delicious. Views are magnificent and truly nature friendly. You can feel the breeze from Kandalama lake, through out the day.

Enjoyed the one night stay at a Luxury room category and simply awesome!!!! üíØ",Positive

Loved the place. Location and food is awesome. Friendly staff. Only negative point is no kids pool. Other than that everything is perfect.,Positive
"Ecofrandli oriented hotel
Electrical facilities (outlets, light switches) are a bit outdated and inconvenient, but the beautiful natural scenery and friendly service make up for this shortcoming.
A beautiful hotel that left me with memories and memories that I would definitely want to visit again later, if time permits.",Positive
"Unique hotel you will never go back to
You can understand why it is said that it is a hotel you must visit before you die..!!
The hotel's own facilities are old and there is no Wi-Fi, but I was in nature, so it was acceptable and rather goodüíö
Must visit if you come to Sri Lanka
Monkeys, bats, lizards, and various animals are so cute, the staff are very friendly, and the view of Kandalama Lake is nothing to speak of.

tip: I think it would be nice to request half board or breakfast only and eat at the snack bar at that time!",Positive
What a great experience,Positive
"This is a place where you can be more relaxed atmosphere people coming and enjoying the food and natural sceneries of kandalama lake near to the hotel...kandalama tank is a very big lake and elephant s are usually surrounding in the evening people visiting to kandalama hotel can be watch those animals in their lobies.very cleanliness place with mouth watering good food. Most of the foriners  waiting to visit Sri Lanka besides watching elephants and always come to see the site visits..
Highly cost and sometimes they give offer s to sri lankans and foreign people to visit there.
All the surrounding are made by natural resources and didn't harm even any trees or any animal.
Kandalama hotel is designed and developed by Mr.Jeffry Bawa who made famous Bawa gardens in down south. Some architecture of it is relatively close to kandalama hotel architecture. Some people coming to the place and admire the beauty of the sri lanka. A lot of articles and news are published on this.
Wedding s and ceremonies are done in this way  around. Birds, squirrels, are surrounded.",Positive
Excellent customer service.. enjoyed very much,Positive
Absolutely wonderful place,Positive
"Amazing setting and beautiful architecture. The rooms are nice but lack real attention to detail and are a bit worn in places...bathroom, towels.. The food is good and the service is very (overly) attentive. Be aware of the restaurant dress code to avoid any unwelcome issues. Overall a good experience.",Positive
"I genuinely don't even know where to start!
This hotel is the pinnacle of Sri Lankan hospitality - offering the authentic wealth of Kandalama‚Äôs nature, without compromising on luxury.

We were welcomed with fresh white lotuses, delicious drinks, and a personalised tour of the hotel by their very friendly staff.

Being a massive fan of Geoffrey Bawa (the genius architect of the hotel) I later approached the reception in hopes of maybe receiving a short, recited paragraph or a small pamphlet. What I received was a more than one hour, personalised tour by naturalist  Nalinda Samaranayake, in which we explored pretty much every inch of the hotel, learning information I could  never have found online. For example, the large rocks in front of the reception was an intentional measure of caution to protect the forefront pillars from misguided vehicles. and the ubiquitousness of the dragonflies around the premises are a testament to the lack of chemicals and synthetic fertilisers in the gardens. There were many, many, many more interesting bits of context and Easter eggs that are so easily missed.

He took us around the entire hotel and explained the rationale around every nook and cranny, its history and accolades an everything in between. I truly appreciate the time he gave us and the effort he went into.

In fact, the entire working staff of the hotel was nothing short of brilliant. They were prompt, intentional, intuitive and attentive to each need, and went above and beyond to ensure our comfort and access to modern commodities. A special shout out to the chefs - each meal brought the pleasure of variety and decadent flavours regardless of cravings, with attention to detail and consistency seeped into each dish.

In addition to the fine food and incredible services, the exposure to nature was splendid. We spotted an entire herd of elephants between the trees, and the audacious monkeys were frequent visitors to our balcony. The flora is entirely native and it‚Äôs clear that human interference is kept to the absolute minimum. The view of the lake and the forest is unmatched and the integration of hotel and outdoors is so seamless that sight and sound of nature surrounds you in every room, corridor and hallway.

I could write a book on the merits of this hotel, and I doubt my obsession could do it justice. I have fallen head over heels, and plan to return soon. This hotel is well worth your time and money, a place to lose yourself in the beauty of Sri Lanka.",Positive
"Checked in today for 3 nights and I must say, this hotel is truly and architectural master piece. The 'sense of arrival' is perfect with beutiful views of the Kandalama lake as you drive in to reception. The team member that did my sign up was really pleasant and sweet and went out of her way to explain everything. She made sure that we had a very good first impression which is important. Dinner staff was good and attentive. The buffet dinner wasn't what I remembered from 4 years ago, but considering the current tourist situation in the country, was very good with lots of choices. Really talented traditional sri lankan band playing in lobby at night, great place to enjoy a coffee after dinner. Beautiful view of Sigiriya Rock over the kandalama lake from the balcony. Jacuzzi in the large bathroom has the same view as the balcony too and has the best rain shower! Of you are in Sri lanka, spend atleast a day in this hotel. Expensive but worth the treat.",Positive
"The location was very good. It was very peaceful. However, the customer service did not feel like a 5-star hotel, they kept rushing us to eat as they said they were closing and I wouldn't have expected this from a 5-star hotel and this is my first time experiencing this poor service.",Positive
"What a location, fully integrated with nature. I used the two pools with my kids extensively. While I didn't go there for the meals, they were excellent, my extended family liked it.",Positive

"Good hotel to visit in spare time. We visited as a couple when there were less crowd. The hotel is located next to Kandalama lake. There are 3 swimming pools, but only 2 were operating due to the less crowd. The second day buffet also canceled and set menu was available due to less crowd. Food was very tasty and many varieties were there. We got the deluxe room with the jacuzzi. We could see the sunrise from our room which is a very beautiful scene. The room is a bit smaller when compared to similar type hotels may be  because this is somewhat old. The hotel premises is blended with green concept very well, where we can see trees and bushes everywhere. Monkeys also roaming very freely. The staff is also very helpful and polite. Overall experience is good. üòçüëç",Positive
"Visited the hotel for lunch. Stunning views of the lake, whilst in a venue, that‚Äôs half built inside a mountain. An oasis of luxury.
Obviously not the cheapest place around, but full menu, full cocktail list, amazing service, with the visit!",Positive
This hotel is like a dream to me. Such a beautiful place. Hotel is surrounded with really good views of the forest and the Kandalama lake. We went there for our first wedding anniversary and the vibes were really good and romantic. Rooms are big and spacious with good facilities. The balcony opens up to the view of the Kandalama lake. Also wild animals can be seen from the balcony. Mornings in the balcony with that view was really pretty. Bird singings and jungle vibes are soo good. Pools are also good with beautiful views. Food is also really good. The staff was friendly too. I really loved the stay and looking forward for another stay in here.,Positive

"I have been into Heritance Kandalama 12 times with my family. We planned to bring our brother family but as per their hotel rules they consider them as foreigners. If that‚Äôs the case they should state it at the beginning itself. We were 8 of us travelled together, and wasted our hrs of day saying back and forth talking their high authorities
I will never come back to Heritance kandalama again in my life
We walked out of the hotel without staying over at Heritance Kandalama",Negative

It's amazing to see how you have consistently kept the same standards for the 43 years I have been on this planet :). Rough times ahead for Sri Lanka, I hope that the brand and staff are able to come out of this debacle with the same steadfastness that they have shown in past times. Also hope to come stay at the property the next time I'm in Lanka. All the staff were great with their service and I forget most of their names, special thanks to Dhanushka, Rasika at the bar area &amp; Padmi at the shop who dressed me. I feel very sorry and helpless that these hard working ppl are in for a struggle but I'm hopeful that you'll come through this. Thank you for a wonderful stay.",Positive

"Geoffrey Bawa's masterpiece
- Kandalama Heritanc

Kandalama Hotel covered with greenery
(Kandalama, Dambulla)
Distance from Colombo 169 km

Created by Jeffrey Bawa, this Cyrilka Kandalama Hotel is located in the Kandalama Great Forest Reserve. The 965-foot-long, 162-room apartment is an example to everyone living in the country of recycling anything disposable without mixing it into this beautiful environment. Originally known as the Kandalama Hotel, the Heritance Kandalama Hotel is a 5 star hotel built on the Kandalama Reservoir in Sri Lanka. It belongs to the Aitken Spence Travels hotel chain. It is an eco-friendly feature to use elephants and horses instead of vehicles to watch the birds and the surrounding area.",Positive

"Definitely worth it! The only 5* hotel that‚Äôs worth  visiting in Sri lanka as far as I saw. A master piece architecture and the nature surrounding the spot is beautiful! Be aware that the hotel is in a deserted area, basically the nearest shop is half an hour drive so make sure you have everything you need. The only 2 notes I‚Äôve about the facility itself is:
1- there‚Äôs no supermarket, pharmacy nor shops inside which‚Äôs disappointing as the hotel is very big and in a deserted area so it should have had some shops for convenience
2- showers don‚Äôt have an adjustable shower pad, it‚Äôs not a big deal but for girls who would like not to have a full shower, it‚Äôs very convenient to have adjustable shower pads not to ruin her hair",Positive
"Amazing location üíï, delicious food ,friendly  service",Positive
"Built on the side of a rock mountain and in the middle of a tropical jungle, the Heritance Kandalama is a unique experience. It's unique because of it's architecture, open spaces, lovely rooms with absolutely private terraces and bathrooms with a viewüòç (see photos below).
The entire staff, from the desk clerks all the way to the cleaning service, are all ultra professional. They are all friendly, kind and accommodating.
The dining experience is also exceptional no matter where and what you choose. There is a wide variety of food options: in the snack area, the grand buffet, √† la carte as well as room service. In three days we tried all services and there was plenty to choose from.
The pools are a must if you wish to truly stay refreshed and relax in a quiet environment. However, be warned, the rock pool is a unique experience, especially when the monkeys decide to join you. ü§£
In the past three days we have enjoyed seen monkeys, mongoose, monitor lizards, bats, a swarm of bees, and an array of more than 30
different types of birds.
The Heritance Kandalama is a unique destination in and of itself - it is by far one of our favorite hotels in Sri Lankaüíï Actually we have enjoyed it so much we decided to stay an extra dayüòé",Positive
"Currently staying at this hotel. I‚Äôll give credit where credits is due, views are exceptional and concur the hotel has great food.

***Update. Restaurant manager came and personally spoke to me about the prior issue I had and took care of me personally and met with me on a few occasions to make sure I was happy. Service and hospitality is exceptional. Please ensure he is commended for fixing my experience. Updated to 5 stars!!!",Positive
Hands down best hotel in Sri Lanka!,Positive
"Spectacular hotel in a privileged location.
Amazing pool, reception and bar under the porch.
Very large rooms and bathroom with Jacuzzi with views. Perhaps they are already in need of some reform, the hotel was built in 1992 by the famous local architect Goffrey Bawa.
At night the noise of the jungle is impressive, a pity that the terraces are practically unusable by the monkeys that take advantage of the slightest mistake to sneak into the room!
A must on your visit to Sri Lanka!",Positive
Magnificent architecture structure between Kandalama Lake and a mountain range. Thank you for making our vacation so relaxing.,Positive
"Absolutely stunning (real architectural gem) and welcoming hotel in an utterly idyllic location - the photo is simply of the welcome lobby.

Do not have words to express how lovely everyone was. Fabulous facial from Eka in the beautiful spa, and the food at both breakfast and dinner buffets was of highest quality and excellent variety - you have to try their chicken, prawn and aubergine curries even if you are a westerner who is a bit scared of spice!

Please visit if you are in the area to visit Sigirya / Dambulla cave temple, honestly no more tranquil base",Positive
Superb location,Positive
Great experience. Food and Staff was excellent!!,Positive
"Good staff, good food, good room and good view. Pool could have been better as there were some leaves there but it was not that big issue. Overall very satisfied.",Positive
"Spectacular setting with rocks from the mountain forming part of the hotel reception and structure. The views are breathtaking. It's great to see all the monkeys and wildlife and feel part of the jungle. The property is huge, spread across almost 1km. Facilities are good and diverse. Basic gym, infinity pools, spa. Buffet restaurant is excellent",Positive
"Absolutely superb. Clean with good food.
The staff were really friendly and the design of the hotel and facilities were superb. Best of all is the location in the middle of the jungle with a view over to Dambulla rock. Boat trip and trecking were superb.
Also enjoyed the various forms of  live traditional music the hotel put on in the evening for anyone who was interested.
I very much hope to return here soon.",Positive
"Terrible hotel. This is a scam hotel not a 5-star hotel. They have not spend any money on sound proofing the hotel. You can hear everything in every room around you. All people walking by can hear, the music in the hallway can hear. There is a crack in the door. Bed and blankets are terrible. I really wish I can have my money back and my time as I didn't sleep at all. Really horrible. Do not come if you are annoyed by loud sounds and terrible bed.",Negative
"When arriving at the hotel, the first impression is: WOW. Located almost at the peak of a mountain, amazing views are guaranteed. But this hotel disappointed me very much. It is very outdated, the hotel only offers a few sunbeds at their pools - which is not enough to ensure everyone can relax at the pool. Considering this feedback has been given before in older reviews, it is absolutely a disgrace to their visitors that this feedback has not been having a follow up. In addition: some sunbeds definitely need to be replaced. The food in the hotel is okay, but not 5*-like. During breakfast, cheeses and yoghurts are not being cooled - which is a possible disaster given the fact that these could cause food illnesses. Every day I had to ask for cold yoghurt, because the one in the display was warm. You are wondering how they seriously take the care of their food without reach and sight of their guests. The rooms are outdated, dirty jacuzzi in the room. The room was dirty and moldy, so was the minibar. The water tap in the bath room was more than 20 years old, given the fact that chalk was all around",Negative
"What an incredible experience. If you are coming to Sri Lanka, staying at the hotel is a must!

Location:
The hotel is a bit isolated and good luck booking taxi/tuk tuk, you'll need to ask the hotel to book something for you. But the hotel is set in an amazing jungle location on the banks of a reservoir. It's a short drive to Dambulla and Sigriya

Rooms/Facilities:
Rooms are stunning with jungle/lake views. Good size, modern decoration and kept really clean. Hotel has 3 swimming pools, a good sized gym and a number of restaurants/eating areas.

Service:
The staff here are incredible. So friendly and nothing is too much of an ask.",Positive
"Awesome place to stay and relax. Friendly staff, good food, lovely place for those who love nature... lots of  birds.

Been here multiple times, and would love to go there again and again. Being a person who loves nature, and birds, its a great place to spend time. For a person who is willing to spend time with being patient, it is definitely and oasis, when it comes to the birds. Need to be a person who can endure long hours of standing and walking long distances.

A small walk down the drive from the hotel and you will find a walking path to the lake itself, where one would get the chance of feeling the breeze and dip you feet in cool water. If you are a person who is willing walk, then the best time would be the early hours of the morning, where you will not be suffering from the heat. A small walk even in the evening would be great, but need to be mindful as by the time it becomes dark, as you do not want to cross wildlife, specially elephants.",Positive
"One of the best hotel in Srilanka that I have visited,  the environment,  Rooms, food everything was best , a must visit place in Srilanka",Positive
"One of the best hotels in Sri Lanka for a holiday. Enjoy the sunset, fresh air, food, beautiful people, Great service and the nature.

"We stayed at the Heritance Kandalama for two nights in March 2022.  We arranged transport through the hotel from Colombo and back which was probably one of our best decisions, due to the difficult driving.  We were picked up on time by Bandar, who was very a professional and a good driver/tour guide.  He also took us on our excursion to Sirigiya (Lion Rock) and the Temple Caves in Dambula the next day and drove us back to Colombo via Kandy.  Bandar paid special attention to all our needs.  He has a good knowledge of wildlife, especially bird and knows the area very well.  The hotel itself is a Geoffrey Bawa masterpiece and a must-visit.  We were greeted by General Manager and upgraded to the Royal Suite, which made our stay even more special, as we were two couples and could therefore relax together in the main lounge of the suite.  The balconies overlook either the jungle or the lake, however, it does not matter which side you‚Äôre one, as sitting outside and listening to the sounds of the birds and monkeys make one forget about the hastiness of life and when you top that with a treatment from the beautiful spa, one can certainly relax and enjoy nature.  One thing for sure is that all the hotel staff is well-trained and understands how to make every guest feel welcome and special, from the cleaners, porters, shop assistants, waiters, chefs, etc.  On departure the Assistance Resort Manager wished us farewell with lovely home-made jams from the hotel.  Wow, what a place!  Thank you Heritance Kandalama and thank you Aitken Spence!",Positive
Bawa's wonder land,Positive
"Our stay at this hotel was faultless. The rooms are lovely, the views are incredible, they have daily excursions but what makes it particularly special is the amazing staff. They are tentative, kind and helpful. They made the stay what it was. Congratulations to heritance group for having such a great work force. ü•∞",Positive
"I‚Äôm not going to blame about their location or service Bcz it was amazing.
Their food was Horrible
I ordered butter cake as my snack they gave me some kind of cake decorated with cream then I tasted it and I could feel that the cake was very old . Immediately I called the reception and complained they cancelled my bill which was good .
Next Day for the al carte menu ordered baked cheese cake as dessert
They gave me the same cake which I had last day telling me this is a baked cheese cake (actually I‚Äôm a baker) it was very bad . I felt soo bad their service was poor
Their menu also very poor need to be updated",Negative
"The most beautiful hotel i have ever stayed in. This was heaven amidst jungle. Surrounded by the most picturesque views of mountains, a lake and forest area, this was  natural beauty at its peak. Room was good, not too big though, but spacious enough, there were 2 pools, large seating areas, food in the restaurant was also good, options were a little limited for vegetarians though. Overall an amazing experience. Rooms were expensive but the stay was totally worth it.",Positive
Nice place for a weekend,Positive
"Gorgeous view from every room (rooms are only lake-side), great amenities, most beautiful infinity pool, spacious rooms, jacuzzi in the bathroom, great staff, and very helpful. Animals everywhere, really fantastic natural experience, great atmosphere with local live music in the evening.

Food was ok but nothing special, for this price (especially for the restaurant) I would expect better
Some equipment is old and problematic, our jacuzzi broke twice.
It could be a little bit cleaner. It is far from dirty, but the hotel is old, and some parts don't look really clean.

Overall it's still a great experience and I wholeheartedly recommend it!",Positive
"Our 3rd visit here and the standards of the hotel were well maintained with their hospitality, extensive buffet and clean rooms. However it feels like it's time for a refurbishment of the rooms.",Positive
A place I will always remember as a very pleasant experience.,Positive
Its a beautiul getaway. Love the place,Positive
Cool hotel with unique architecture and interiors. Comfortable and clean rooms. Place is becoming quite dated now and could use a refresh. Staff are friendly and good breakfast. Location & views are üëå. Some small suggestions to management 1. The pool water is cloudy meaning it's dirty.... 2. Invest in better sunbeds and some PARASOLS! 3. Better soaps in the bathrooms,Positive
"Lovely location & Geoffrey Bawa's unique architecture, with minimal disturbance to nature.  The bird- watching tour by boat early morning is a wonderful start to the day, accompanied by the hotel naturalist who is very  friendly & knowledgeable .",Positive

"Kandalama Kandalama Kandalama.

I have booked this for my parents as a gift. Mmm check in was bit messy. They were Really  disappointed about the reception service and also reservations department. (Requested for a room with better view. But they have chosen a room with a view of outdoor washrooms. Super dissatisfied! When my parents said that they won‚Äôt stay in there, then they had given a better room with a nice view. But why can‚Äôt they give it without disappointing them. Even no welcome drink for them. Hmmmmm.)

Please don‚Äôt do this to any one.

But then all were good. Super Resturant service and every other people were very helpful and nice. Location and everything earns 6 stars. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

But reception and reservations made it into ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

Disappointing! But cheers for others!",Positive
"We loved the Heritance Kandalama. From the afternoon arrival, enjoying a beverage by the pool while the sunsets, and local musician. The monkeys playing in the vines that draw the building and the mountainous rock integration into the building structure. The staff were amazing, and the restaurants were also. There was truly nothing to fault at this incredible hotel. Thank you.",Positive
"Horrible experience!

Nothing went well in this hotel. The experience was horrible, and I consider it the worst hotel I stayed at on my journey to Sri Lanka. Moreover, the room was not clean and there was a spider nest in one of the tables.

Disliked ¬∑ 1- You have to take off-road for about ten minutes to reach the hotel.
2- The internet is super slow where you can barely use WhatsApp or any other instant messages apps. It is super slow to the limit you can not use google sometimes.
3-The insects and bats are everywhere. To go to the restaurant you have to pass by three bats flying at the entrance of the restaurant. In addition, there was a lizard inside the restaurant next to our table. It was an unpleasant experience at all having dinner at the restaurant.
4- The staff of the restaurant was unprofessional and unfriendly at all. One of them gave us the bill to pay for it and once I told him my booking was half-board he replies rudely you have to pay for the drinks. He could simply be polite and reply "" sorry sir, but half-board booking does not include beverages"". In addition, I asked him for napkins and he gave them to me as like he wants to hit me.
5-The next day, I ordered breakfast to have in my room. I had to wait 45 minutes for the room services to bring it. Unfortunately, when I told the guy I waited for you for 45 minutes he replied "" 45 minutes!!!"" and then looked at his phone as he didn't believe me and then replied impolitely "" oh yes 45 minutes sorry"". Is this an appropriate method to treat the residents?
5-Due to the bad experience at the restaurant, the next day I wanted to have dinner in my room. However, this was an unpleasant experience again. After waiting so long for the dinner, the guy came and to be honest he was polite, but he brought a bill with him and I told him my booking is half-board so the dinner should be included. I called the room services and they told me rudely that half-board booking is only at the restaurant so if you want to have your dinner in the room you have to pay for it! so I asked them to call the manager and he replied I will call him and back to you.",Negative
"Many amenities at a good price.
The rooms are spacious and comfortable, a little dated and some things like stains and wear in the bathroom could do with a fix.
It has many green areas and the views are very amazing.
The breakfast buffet is quite extensive and very fresh. The dinner in the room is quite large and rich.
They have good rules against COVID but they are not strict. Lots of people walking around the hotel and restaurant without a mask and the employees saying nothing. Remember that this virus does not differentiate nationality. They should be stricter with their sanitary rules. It is for the good of everyone.",Positive
Great!!! Lovely hotel!,Positive
"Don‚Äôt pay 200usd for the cave dinner! The food was so disappointing, and not even worth half the money. - ( we complained and got 1/4 back. ) I would recommend the buffet instead.  Besides that, the place is cool and the view is amazing. Staff is superb!  - one thing they are missing is some  better furniture there‚Äôs no soft couches og lounge areas where you can chill relax.",Positive

"Wanted to state how I got an extremely unprofessional way from‚Äù Sanjeewa‚Äù at the reception as I wanted a 2-3 hours late checkout but he was an unwelcoming and very offensive.

How sad that a hotel like this hire such people.

I guess all this is that because I didn‚Äôt use the taxi that he referred to which is X 200 times more expensive than the normal ones.

And the star that I put is for the look from inside the room that many will like.",Negative

Foods are delicious...very friendly staff.",Positive
"Excellent hotel! Varied breakfasts, friendly staff, clean comfortable rooms with a magnificent view. Sometimes monkeys come to visit the balconies)",Positive
"this is just a dessert for architects, the greatest hotel project of the famous Geoffrey Bawa. This is a classic project of an ecological building, so harmoniously inscribed in nature that the hotel itself is like an hour of the jungle, on the lake, around the mountains and the forest, a delightful place",Positive
"There was a great variety of food for both breakfast and dinner.  Food was also very good. However,it would be great if a live hopper station can be introduced for dinner or breakfast. Also,it would be a great addition if breakfast were to include Sri Lankan pancakes and halapa that foreign and local tourists both will be able to enjoy and experience. This can probably be done by reducing a couple of items ( e.g. cold salad) from current breakfast menu. This was my third visit and the first time I stayed overnight. Looking forward to return.",Positive
"Good hotel for staycation. Even though it is a 5 üåü hotel you want get exact 5 üåü standard here.

3 swimming pools available.
1. Large pool
2. Infinity pool
3. Natural pool

Food is good. No much space to roam in the surrounding, bcoz it's in the middle of the jungle. But hotel arrange activities like birdwatching, boat riding etc.

"A hotel that used to be probably wow
He is already sleeping and the cleanliness is not at a high level
And the food is mediocre
At the same time, the view is crazy and the building itself is located right in the heart of the Gungle and it seems that the Gungle takes over it",Negative
Great place with a great view. Food was so good.,Positive
"I would rate the hotel as good, we heard a lot about it and expectations were high.

What I want to highlight for 5+ is the service, concierge, housekeeping, food and spa are just great. The guy who cleaned the room is beyond praise. 24/7 birdsong. Monkeys that visited the room, it's all very cool and atmospheric.

Of the minuses:
- Poor sound insulation, you can hear everything and everyone;
- Small pools, there are not enough sun loungers (there are only about 30 of them and this is for three pools), some of them need to be updated;
- The hotel seems to be for relaxation and privacy, in fact there are many families with children who are very noisy and loud and disrupt a comfortable relaxing stay.
- Eco-park in which there are no animals, there is nothing but plants, what is the use of it - it is not clear. Not even an employee there.

In general, it is ideal for arriving on weekdays for 4-5, and then if the above-mentioned disadvantages are not significant.",Positive
"I stayed at Heritance Kandalama with my brother and we were extremely amazed and happy with hospitality and services which have been provided by Heritance ""K"" team during our short stay. They go extra mile to ensure customers comfort which is not so common in this changing Era.

Food was outstanding and with many options available at buffet. Rooms are well maintained and cleanliness of the hotel is up to our standard.

We would like to share our compliments with Heritance team especially, Sanjeewa, Shanthi , Sujeeth and Gamini very helpful throughout the stay and approachable.

We absolutely loved our stay and although Dambulla has so many hotels. We will definitely return to this lovely property on our next stay",Positive
"Stayed in Panoramic room, the views were incredible from it (Specially the morning views and the birdsongs). An Amazing and beautiful place to stay at. One of the best property to stay in Sri Lanka with a unique nature experience. The Food is really great here. The staff is really helpful and extremely professional.

Add On : - Heritance Kandalama is a real architectural gem, designed by Geoffrey Bawa. Built from natural stone and hidden in the greenery, it is designed to blend seamlessly with its natural surroundings, where monkeys and elephants roam freely.",Positive

"I went there in few months back and the experience was not pleasant. First thing was I requested lake view room ,when did my booking and I didn't get that kinds of a room that other hotels provides that kinds of a request.
Second thing was when i arrived to room with reception officer, Some one in the room with maintaining TV while fully sanitized sticker was in the door.
Thirdly the booklet hotel also used one , Someone draw a picture there ,most probably the previous customer. I wondered why they didn't change it in this kind of a covid situation .

Buffet was Terrible , Very small variant buffet and those are also not tasty .

Hotel view and the design is really perfect. For me its not worth for money as  booking charges are high, But must visit hotel in Sri Lanka",Positive
"A very photogenic and an iconic hotel in Sri Lanka. An experience for a lifetime.

Visitors could spend some quality time appreciating the nature.

Make sure to explore the hotel and its amenities, the pool, various nooks and art pieces. Do not leave the balcony windows open or you could be replaced by monkeys..",Positive

Also staff are really nice and efficient, rooms are perfectly cleaned :) Definitely my favorite!",Positive
"+ the hotel takes place perfectly in its environment and the view from the rooms and the pool area are amazing,
- Sri Lanka cuisine has so much to offer and we have been a bit disappointed with some of the food which were to us too much western (burgers, fries‚Ä¶)",Positive
"You can try all the varieties foods in here.
So calming environment.
Try to stay at least two nights, Then you can get better hotel experience here
Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è",Positive
We stayed 7 nights here in November 2021. Family with 9 month old and 4 year old.  We had booked 2 rooms but they offered us a suite instead which we took and we were so pleased we did. It was an amazing room with an awesome view and monkeys on our balcony most days. The food was good and a huge choice but due to covid the staff served us which was a bit annoying as you had to wait for them.  The pool wasn't kept as clean as I'd like but the rooms were kept nice and clean and all the staff were friendly. My main disappointment was being offered free laundry service and then being charged for it.  I missed it on the bill as I was in a rush to get out as we had a trip.  I forgot to mention the spa services were amazing. My husband and I had 2 treatments each as they were so good and reasonably priced.,Positive
"Beautiful setting and architecture, but a lot missing! The hotel can‚Äôt be beaten for the view and the way it‚Äôs set into the jungle and rocks with monkeys climbing on the balcony regularly you feel so close to nature, but for a 5* hotel and the price we were disappointed. The restaurant had zero atmosphere with average food and high prices. The majority of staff were not particularly friendly, which is the opposite of what we have found everywhere else in Sri Lanka! Due to its location (a drive down a very long and bumpy  dirt track) taxis are required to get everywhere which is fine but the hotel charges extortionate amounts if you book through them. Once we had a couple of local contacts we saved so much money.  We also felt some areas of the hotel were tired and needed some attention (for example we couldn‚Äôt get the plug out to drain the jacuzzi bath- that we‚Äôd paid extra for - and someone had to come with a plunger each time). Maybe they are just catching up post-covid but the vibe is strange!",Positive
A perfect hotel for nature lovers.,Positive
"Me and my partner stayed here for 2 nights over a 4 week visit in Sri Lanka. The hotel is architecturally beautiful! Draped in foliage, surrounded by jungle on the edge of a breathtaking lake - The views were incredible! All the rooms have a private balcony with a choice of lake or garden. Ours was lake which was lovely however we met a couple staying in a garden view who saw elephants right outside their room in the hotel grounds at dawn. 2 of the 3 pools were open during our visit and we loved the natural pool. The cocktails were great (but beware of leaving them unattended because it will soon attract the monkeys!) The food was probably the most average throughout our stayed which was a little disappointing for a 5 star hotel. We ate better in all the guesthouses we stayed in. The views are the best thing about this hotel, it was a great place to spend 2 days by a nice pool after a lot of hiking but thats it",Positive
"Lovely location, good service, but the international buffet, was lower than the the 5 star hotels in Colombo.",Positive
"Great food, service and hotel by Bawa!!! Although the acccess is quite complicated, it is really worth visiting!!",Positive

Excellent place. This is my second visit here in Kandalam. Still one of the best place to relax and enjoy.,Positive
"We were given an upgrade from a Jacuzzi room to a suite, which was indeed a welcome upgrade. The property is gorgeous! So close to nature- I would advise sparing a day just to spend in the resort.
Staff is super courteous! Was extremely impressed by the room service staff and they serve you breakfast in your room on request which was amusing as most resorts(ever the luxury ones) stock to the standard buffet breakfast formats!
View from the rooms is excellent! And you will see a lot of langoors outside your windows!",Positive
Superb,Positive
"Good environment with calm full nature.
Hotel rooms need to be updated.

Pros:
- Bathroom is excellent.
- Mountain and lake views from the hotel and around it are amazing.
- Staff are friendly and service is very good.
- Food is great.
- Good live music and Singers.
- Monkeys everywhere.

Cons:
- Bedroom smell is just a little bit off.
- Buffets are a little expensive compared to other high end hotels in Sri Lanka.",Positive
"Magical place. The main pleasure is of course the architecture, many view balconies and cozy places where you can enjoy the view or watch the monkeys in their natural environment. It was an unforgettable experience for us and I highly recommend it!
Everything is very well organized, goddesses work in the spa, the staff is very polite, the food is delicious.
The hotel is eco and it is read in every detail. They try to practically not use polyethylene and plastic. Even the Christmas decorations were all made from paper and twigs.",Positive
This hotel is just amazing. Unfortunately we had just 1 night over here.,Positive
"Beautiful place, amazing views for evening ü•∞",Positive
"Don‚Äôt waste your money on this buffet. We weren‚Äôt staying here but came for dinner, excited about the prospect of a 5 star hotel buffet. It was extremely underwhelming and low quality especially considering the price (LKR 60,000/person). We would happily pay that for quality food and variety (like the buffet at Jetwing Lake, which was far superior and also cost less) but most of the selection here lacked flavor and was also not prepared fresh- grilled prawns for example, which could easily be grilled in the wok to order, sat cooked and waiting to be picked up. The service was good but this was a massive disappointment. There were a few highlights (chicken curry for one) but absolutely nothing that warrants the price and overall certainly does not live up anywhere near to the expectation. Save yourself the disappointment and go to the buffet at Jetwing Lake!",Positive
Loved the whole experience. Very professional and highly trained staff. Tasty food and drinks.,Positive
"Heritance kandalama is a very tranquil and pleasant place. It has amazing rooms and delicious food. It has 3 swimming pools and it also has a very beautiful view at the 5th and 6th floors. Overall, it's highly recommend.",Positive
"Heritance Kandalama is one of the iconic 5 star hotels in Sri Lanka. Even though it's showing its age after standing for more than 2 decades Heritance Kandalama still is one of the best for the design and the facilities it offers the guests. The jungle access road to the hotel itself is thoroughly enjoyable even before reaching this landmark hotel. The hotel consisting of different wings is built into the jungle preserving the wilderness and the mountains. We were lucky to be upgraded to the best suite on the top floor. It's a vast suite like an apartment. It's got a great bathroom, big bed room, a living area and a sundeck. Sundeck is, of course, my favorite place being a Photographer and a Naturalist. Built against the Rocky mountain side covered in foliage the breeze running across is very comfortable - though extremely powerful. Wild life is abundant here with Giant Squirrels, Monkeys, Butterflies, Birds, Mongoose and Barking Deer paying visits from time to time. From the balcony I could get a good glimpse of the activity going on in the Kandalama lake beneath and beyond me. Fishermen in their boats on the water and the birds of prey hovering above are a pleasure to watch. Food served in the restaurant is delicious. The restaurant itself is artfully designed. The carpark is not adequate considering the size of the hotel having a large number of rooms. The playground is a nice addition.",Positive
One of our favorite places. Choice of food could be better like before. Rooms need some attention. Staff is excellent as always. Would visit any time without any hesitation .,Positive
One of the best destination in Sri Lanka with delicious üòã foods and best hospitality. Worth it üôÇ,Positive
&#13;&#10;It&#39;s a beautiful place with lots of entertainment avenues. Love the great hospitality offered towards guest and caring. Food was delicious and room service was timely... looking forward to experience same kind of service in the future...,Positive
"A well known 5-star hotel boasting a unique nature experience didnt disappoint when it came to creating the atmosphere. It is unpretentious, spacious, & felt very homely. The food service was decent, but due to covid situation sometimes you have to wait till someone serves the food as there aren't as many cooks/ servers available. We had to wait 1.5hrs to check in after booking well in advance but they upgraded our rooms as a courtesy which was nice.",Positive
it was an amazing stay at kandalama.....extraordinary delicious food....huge verites... friendly staff...superb environment....,Positive
"Beautiful hotel with Excellent landscape and views. Felt like living in a jungle
Friendly and professional staff .",Positive
Stayes at Heritance Kandalama in december 2021. One of the best places to include in your trip for a peaceful stay. A secluded place amidst nature with good food and calm surroundings. Extremely clean and hygienic. Hospitality is great. Rooms are also clean and sanitized. Most recommended.,Positive
"Very attractive hotel
Super friendly service
delicious foods with different types",Positive
Nice ambient with nature friendly surroundings.,Positive
Perfect place,Positive
"Staff looked very overworked. To the point where you don't want to ask for Thier help. Food is good. But the variety is not that much in the buffet. We got a very lower floor room eventhough we Arrived early (around 3pm), which was very disappointing. Not worth the money even at 1/3 of a discounted price. Can find much better experience at a lower price.",Positive
"We stayed for 1 night on our way to Colombo. Since it was a weekend during December it was very crowded. However, the staff were very efficient and the everything was done quickly. The hotel was strictly following COVID-19 health guidelines. So it felt safe.

The room and the bathroom was very clean with all amenities and was designed nicely. We had a juncle view room. It was beautiful. The room was very comfortable.

They had buffet for all 3 meals (for fullboard basis). The food was exceptional. The had a wide variety including International, local and desserts.

The property was massive and located on a rock overlooking the lake and nature. The was a plunge pool and 2 other pools with a view of the lake. There were several vantage points with panoramic views.

There was also a well equipped gym and a separate gaming area.

The carparks are located a little away from the hotel and the hotel provided shuttle service to and from the car park.

The staff were friendly and extremely professional.

They were strict on check in and check out times. Which could have been little flexible.

The hotel was designed beautifully and the overall ambience was great. Overall great experience and worth the money. Highly recommended.",Positive
"Nice location. One of the best architecturing. Great hospitality. Special thank goes to Mr. Lalith, Mr. Giragama and Mr. Sarath for the amazing welcome and hospitality.",Positive
Great destination with a nice view. Kandalama lake and Sigiriya can be view on most rooms and restaurants. Food is delicious and staff are helpful. Prices are bit higher comparing to the other destinations in area.But According to the facilities and view price can be justified. There isn‚Äôt a baby pool. There are 2 pools including natural rock pool.Main swimming pool‚Äôs deep starting from 3 feet.,Positive
This was a very good experience... Staff was very very friendly and help us Everytime they can to experience the hotel to the fullest... Food was amazing everyday there were new stuff to eat... I can safely say that this is one of the best hotels in Sri Lanka.,Positive
Place is really nice. Service needs to be improved.,Positive
Simply awesome experience. Nice location. Superb food. Great hospitality.,Positive
Environment friendly,Positive
"Sri Lanka in general is a great place to connect with yourself. Dambulla specifically is full of peaceful hikes, the famous Sigiriya fort, the majestic Pidurangala and much more that allows you space to get lost. What Heritance Kandalama gives you is a view of Lake Kandalama and the surrounding forest. It helps add to the look & feel that it is right in the middle of the forest. Every morning is a mix bag of bird and animal sounds and amazing view of the cloud covering mountains. Every night is just darkness for as long as the eye can see, just like ancient times. Highly recommended. Please expect a little delay in service and don't let that affect your perception of the place and the amazing people",Positive
"Beautiful place, amazing views. However, the food is not the best for the menu a la cart. In any case the staff try there best to make us feel good and we enjoyed our 5 nights there.",Positive
Awesome architecture and great buffet lunch,Positive
An absolutely fabulous experience! The architecture is something surreal in the way that nature envelops you and calms the senses. An unforgettable stay of which you never get enough. Thank you,Positive
"Wonderful location blending in with the nature seamlessly. Spacious suites opening directly to the wilderness.
While the staff is courteous, they are quite disorganized. We checked in and went straight for lunch as our room wasn't ready. Given we are traveling with an infant, we requested a baby cot in our room. After lunch there was no one to direct us to the room. We had to walk back to the reception to get someone to walk us to the room. Even though it's been over an hour since we checked in at this point, our luggage wasn't brought to the room for another 10 minutes - and a cot was nowhere to be seen. Had to re-request and wait for over an hour, the reception doesn't answer the phone.. etc. etc.
While the hotel itself is nice, the service is far from it.
UPDATE: We had a hot water flask in our luggage, and it's shattered into pieces. Either they threw our bag or dropped it.
Baby cot arrived after eventually getting through to reception and requesting again.
TERRIBLE SERVICE",Positive
"Stayed on my honeymoon.
A very cozy hotel.
It's hard to get there because the means of transportation are limited.",Negative
Great service and staff was kind enough to arrange my brother a complimentary cake for his honeymoon stay.,Positive
"I've stayed at many high-end hotels in the world. I've stayed at the Ritz-Carltons and the Four Seasons hotels for perspective. But this hotel definitely ranks up there with hotels like the Ritz and the Four seasons! The customer experience here is absolutely first class! The cleanliness, attentiveness and luxury is bar none to world class hotels!

This hotel is located in a rainforest next to a man-made lake that was built some 2300 years ago! When you are in your room, you are surrounded by the rainforest and fauna and flora. You literally get the feeling you are living in the middle of a rainforest jungle! You feel your stress simply melt away as you walk into this hotel! This hotel is a MUST EXPERIENCE heaven!!

There are two pools in this hotel you must take a dip in. One is a natural pool with spring water built right into the rock where the natural spring is. The other is the infinity pool that overlooks the rainforest and the giant lake. Both are great and both are 'must experience' pools.

The food was fantastic! The service was fast, friendly and out of this world great! The rooms were spacious, luxurious and very comfortable!

I highly recommend this hotel and will be visiting again with my whole family!",Positive
They know how to treat you royally. From the moment you reach till the moment you depart anything and everything about you will be looked after. Meals are perfect for the theme and brand name. The spectacular view of the untamed nature is a double bonus.,Positive
"Perfect holiday Hotel, Great Ambience, gives a good feel of Nature. There was live Music, Magic show and other activites to enjoy in the Hotel, Good Service. Only thing is they need to give some good vegetarian options for Dining!",Positive
Very beautiful and calm place to stay. Surrounded with whole lot of nature. It takes you away from the worldly loudness to a meditating environment. Their restaurant is something you must try. Their foods are delicious and their buffet is one of the best buffets I ever had. Very friendly and highly professional staff. Very clean and hygienic place to stay. Best experience.,Positive
"We went there for lunch, and the experience from start to finish was lovely. The breathtaking view, the friendly staff, and the delicious food exceeded our expectations.

"A hotel with a very beautiful view. Truly love the design of that hotel and how it blends with the environment. You can get a panoramic view of Dambulla from this place. Hotel service was excellent, and the rooms were spacious. Their buffet was excellent. They maintain the post-covid rules as much as possible.
Only thing to complain about is not providing a room with a good view, though the hotel is half-occupied.",Positive

From the Architectural point of view, this is the best example of ""Tropical Modernism"" of great Architect Geoffrey Bawa. Food and other amenities are all good.",Positive

I could not believe it and was disappointed. They vacuumed  and changed the bed linen only after I informed the room is dusty. It kept me worrying about the safety at pandemic times.

"Had one the worst front desk experience I have ever experienced at Kandalama. Reception staff was very non welcoming... and I was honestly shocked to see such behaviour from a reputed chain as aitken spense. Completely abandoned my enthusiasm to book the place in few minutes. Im glad most of the guys dont do bookings in person. Im pretty sure it wont cross zero.
Also hotel is poorly maintained might not worth ur extra buck. High time management fix those.",Positive

Unique architecture with excellent view. Great food. Helpful and friendly staff. Inside of the room and the bathroom can be improved more.,Positive
"Superb place for a family getaway. One of the best buffet spreads I have experienced in SL. (Usually Sigiriya - Dambulla area food is exceptional irrespectiveof the hotel star grade)

Don't hesitate to make a drive to Kandalama lake, although this act is not encouraged by the Hotel staff as there will be some wild elephants around.

Swimming pool - average

Gym and Spa -  haven't experienced

Problems - Hotel is now 28 years old. Small age related issues are there. Like water spillage from shower cubicles, Mini fridge isn't working etc.",Positive

Thank you.",Positive
I absolutely loved my vacation there. Sir Geoffrey Bawa has done a magnificent job in designing this place. The staff was very friendly and treated guests very well.

The best in the area with excellent service.Super architectural design,Positive
Great view and place but not the all but one staff member doesn't know to respect. I am giving 5 star as a best place. But unhappy with one member in staff. He is only validating clients by their vehicle. But he doesn't know some of them were the auditors who have done the audit in their hotel. Again place was soo good and beautiful.,Positive
Beautiful and luxurious hotel surrounded by nature. The view from the hotel is unforgettable. Rooms are very clean and comfortable. Food is very delicious. Friendly staff. Definitely visit again.,Positive

"My family and I visited Heritance Kandalama in March 2021.
It is quite a long drive to the hotel but SO worth it!
Located in the Central Province, Heritance provides great hospitality, services and incredible views.
Plenty of wildlife there, too.
Nature is infused with the architecture of the place. (another masterpiece by the amazing Geoffrey Bawa).
Also, their infinity pool looks great for the gram ;)

The only downside we encountered was the food.
Their Sri Lankan cuisine was fine but international; not quite tasty. It just felt a bit bland too recycled.

For the most part, urging all to visit.

P.S. do not feed the monkeys.
Once you start, they keep coming back for more.",Positive
Yeah it's very beautiful and amazing place,Positive
Super,Positive
Nice place and delicious food,Positive

"An eco-friendly hotel which has been incorporated into its natural setting.
Built to blend with its surroundings, the Heritance Kandalama is one of the renowned architect Geoffrey Bawa‚Äôs most eco-friendly designs.

Integrating the rock face it nestles against, all of the beautifully-designed rooms, suites and public areas look out over the forest ‚Äì which is alive with monkeys and birds ‚Äì the lake, and Sigiriya Rock in the distance.

This is an eco-tourist‚Äôs paradise. There are two restaurants at the hotel including the main venue Kanchana, where themed buffets are served every evening, and Kaludiya, the fine dining restaurant where you can enjoy a fusion of international flavours. The rooms and suites here are located in one of two wings, one of which has views of Dambulla Rock and the other ‚Äì our particular favourite ‚Äì overlooks the iconic Sigirya Rock Fortress.",Positive

Outstanding hotel on a hill over looking a vast unspoiled natural area near the lake.  Animals are frequently encountered while walking.

Beautiful hotel. Friendly staff. Foods are good.,Positive
"Amazing hotel with stunning view, from the father of the Asia modern architect.

Been in The Heritance Kandalama Hotel on 2015, while visiting Sri Lanka with my friends.
Super friendly staff, awesome facilities, delicious breakfast on all day dining.
You need to suit up to have dinner in their fancy restaurant. Just be careful to not open your window in the morning. The monkeys will come to steal your stuff.
Sure will comeback to stay here soon, when the pandemic is over.",Positive

"One of the worst experience ever. I even regret the fact that I actually booked this hotel for a short holiday. I enjoyed quarantine hotel (Amari Galle) than Kandalama. Your staff is rude. Especially the kitchen stewards. The steward who served me Curd and Bee honey was absolutely rude. I asked him for bee honey and he was like ""you want pickle?"". Then I said I want honey and then he said pickle and honey is the same thing :D. This is definitely not a 5 star hotel. Hospitality is very low. I didn't feel that I actually went for a luxury hotel but a community center. Not gonna recommend to any of my friends. And why people wearing gown and other eastern clothing to the pool ? Hilarious.",Negative

Nice hotel with a beautiful view. The food was very delicious and the staff is very friendly to us.

Thank you Kandalama",Positive
"My family and I visited this hotel expecting a world class experience. But we are utterly disappointed with the bitter experience we received. We checked in by 2.00 pm and had to wait till 5.00 pm to get to our rooms and baggages. The food was fairly good but is very underrated than the quality it is said to be. Though the staff was friendly it was not a very pleasant experiences. Being a family with minors, we had to undergo great difficulties. Please improve these grey areas in your service. We are not hoping to visit this hotel anytime soon.",Positive
"Outlook: Very nice greenery out looking hotel with splendidly viewed with pidurangala,sigiriya and kandalama lake.

"Amazing service beyond Measure !

Medical Emergency, first responce..

My brother under went a medical emergency where he had to be rushed to the Hospital. 10th April 2021..

The staff arranged an Ambulance in no time..  A doctor was arranged, did all necessary first aid and were super cooperative..

The hotel is fully booked, but what they did was way beyond, words cannot do justice.

The Hotel arranged a jeep a van, over 4 staff to accompany us all the way till the hospital, until the patient was discharged attend to all hospital needs.

A special appreciation to Mr Priyan Wijarathne General Manager, Mr. Lalith F&B manager, major IA Wijarathne Security Manager..

This is my 4th visit, visiting since inception.. Their food, service has been to point..
Hoping for many more in the future.

If the management and hotel staff don't like local  tourists visiting the hotel, please don't open it local tourists.

But don't forget during tough times in the local travel industry, it was always the local tourists that kept the hotels going on.

Please take this comments positively and improve the overall service.",Negative

A theme hotel build to blend with the surrounding jungle nurtured by the Kandalama reservoir. Out door and indoor Hotel spaces let you have a chance to communicate with the elite style of Bawa.

Won't recommend for anyother to stay in here since room amamenities are way too poor. There was no power in the room first and then the TV wasn't working.
Plus no bathroom supplies were placed even its a 5 star hotel. Had to pay for those!
One of the most terrible hotel stay ever.

Their service is impeccable however and you will be pampered without a doubt.
Overall a worthwhile visit",Positive
"Our stay was 1 night on full board basis. The place as per usual was fantastic, especially if you‚Äôre a nature lover. The panoramic views are to die for! Although, I must say the food was mediocre. The standards have dropped slightly compared to our last visit. The staff was however very helpful.

p.s. if you inform, they provide a complimentary surprise cake if anyone in your group is celebrating their birthday!",Positive
"A beautiful hotel with a beautiful blend of nature. The service is equally excellent. By far the best service experienced from any hotel personally. They even surprised us a complimentary anniversary cake. All the staff are friendly and helped us individually to all our needs. The Panaromic view room is great too. Super awesome!
Some small suggestions:
1. AC or some generator sound is high when AC is increased. Slight disturbance in room and in balcony.
2. Bidet shower is too powerful.
Only these two I can think of.",Positive
Amazing place ‚ù§Ô∏è,Positive

"Amazing!

This is one of the world's best and highly ranked eco friendly hotel which gives you the best views and a quality service..

You can feel the uniqueness soon after you take the turn hotel side road which directs to the hotel. It is not tarred and surrounded with huge trees. You cannot see any civilization and only see monkeys and butterflies.. but note it's not tarred, but it's well maintained and it's like a carpet road.

Hotel has a very beautiful views and it's one of the beat views.. you can see the Kandalama lake and aigiriya rock.. and the hotel is covered with trees and it gives a total different experience.

It's very well maintained and cleanliy is very good.. all the garden areas and jungle is well maintained.. you can have nature trails as well.

Rooms are very clean and in high quay.view from the room also very unique..

Food is the best part.. Kandalama is known for a best food. It was one of the yummiest food ever had.. even though it didn't have a huge variety (but variety was more than enough for the rate and the current situation) all the items were tasty..

Staff also friendly and very helpful. They are well trained to treat their guests..

Specially we noticed that they have taken lot of effort to keep the covid guidelines.. they disinfect the rooms after guests leave and all the corridors as well.

Overall it's one of the best experiences and must visit destination..keep it up Team Kandalama",Positive

Superb,Positive
Beautiful landscape. The 3rd bed of the 3 pax room is not to the standards. room facilities should be improved. Meal variety should be improved to match the 5-star standard. but the hotel is the most beautiful hotel I have ever visited,Positive
The hotel itself remains wonderful as always. Rather dissapointed with the status of the buffet.,Positive
"It waa a great experience with god food and friendly staff. Specialy during this pandemic period, they are taking all possible steps to protect guests and staff. Rooms and the facility was very clean and kept in great condition.",Positive
Waaaww. Lovely place and will come again,Positive
"NOT RECOMEND if you expect a good customer service from this hotel. The atmosphere is good. So if you really want to enjoy Geoffrey Bawa's architecture, forget about getting good customer service, from here. I have an extremely unpleasant experience and will not choose this hotel again. From the entrance I felt that we were unwelcomed.

Keeping that aside at the dinner time they didn't let us to enter the hall. Reason was our attire was not suitable for the dinner hall. The lady who was there at entrance informed me that only smart casual attire is accepted and that was mentioned in the terms and conditions which I did not read. After telling that she left. So we were waiting there thinking what to do because No one gave an alternative. After waiting some time I again went to that lady and asked since we're not allowed to have the dinner inside, what is the solution for this. To be honest She totally ignored us. She said if you want we can deliver the food to the room. Take the food from the buffet and keep on a table. That's what she said exactly. We were actually surprised on her behavior and this weird situation.

Then I asked if you cant let us to dine in can you arrange a table outside. Because there were tables outside also. She said that's also impossible. Only option was having the dinner inside the room. So we put the plates where she told to put and waited. They took around 35/40 minutes to bring that food to the room and food was cold.

Even we wanted to try some other food it was annoying to go there asking permission to enter and requesting them to bring the food to the room. This is the worst experience I have ever got in a Sri Lankan Hotel. I have traveled all over the country, stayed in many hotels, so far I never had such a bad experience. Heritance Ahungalla customer service is awesome comparing to this. I emailed to the management about this experience and they never accept any of these and they were like it was all my fault. My points are,

1.If there is a dress code they could highlight it. Because people never expect such a situation. They are going out of Colombo. Its a trip. Not a business meeting. But if it is the hotel standard and I respect it. But there should be a alternative and staff should be polite to the guest. Guest are coming, paying to the hotel to enjoy their vacation not to get STRESSED.

2.If any of guests come with a normal t shirt and a short the management can explain the rules nicely and arrange outside table to enjoy the meal which is fair to the guest. But the staff who were in the dining hall never bothered to do so even after my request.

However the email from the management also saying that the fault is not their and it is impossible to happen something like that. But I personally faced to this situation and I felt embarrassed at that moment. My whole vacation was ruined by that incident.",Positive
Excellent,Positive
Such a great place to go with your family and friends.All the meals are delicious and the hotel staff give an excellent service.Its like a hidden paradise cant explain in words.Great  experience...,Positive

"What a peaceful nature embedded hotel to relax!
Whole family enjoyed the stay and it was a nice experience.",Positive
"Heritance Kandalama is one of the precious architectural masterpieces designed by well known architect Mr. Geoffry Bawa. The hotel itself is a part of nature. The buildings have been well covered with lush vegetation and its pretty normal to see wild animals roaming inside the hotel.

This must be the first eco themed hotel concept in Sri Lanka, which the hotel management strictly still following the draft drawn by late Mr. Bawa.

In this pandemic the hotel offers a magnificent service. They are on top of and well concerned about the health guidelines issued by Sri Lankan government.

All the employees are very friendly, enthusiastic and helpful. The food was delicious and had lots of varieties which I personally loved ü•∞

I am in love with the total experience. üòÉüòÉThis is a place one must visit at least once in their lifetime.",Positive

Beautiful place with great view of sunset‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,Positive
"I think the hotel ratings should be reviewed again for this hotel. Because 5 star is not suitable for this anymore. Everyone talks about its glory and the architecture because a famous architect built this hotel. However, hotel staff doesn't care about guests and they have enormous ego. The staff is not friendly and nice. We got a panaromic king room. The room was small and old. Commod was not cleaned (Check the attached picture). The furniture were not comfortable. There were not wall plugs to charge the phone near the bed. In a 5 star hotel there should be a iron for every room. But this hotel rooms are not equipped with irons and when we requested, they rejected our request. We had to argue with them to get an iron.
Last but not least, the food is average. But the main point is they don't follow covid guidelines at the restaurant. The restaurant was full with people. When we got our cutleries, there was a hair inside. They didn't even apologize for their mistake. Amidst the covid pandemic, this hotel doesn't even clean these things well. There are better 5 star hotels for cheaper price near this hotel. I would not recommend this hotel at all.",Positive
"I and my wife visited Heritance Kandalama a week ago. It was a remarkable experience and it was very safe during the prevailing situation in the country. They followed all the health guidelines from the entrance to all the other things. The way of treating, food menu, room arrangement and caring should be appreciated. The location is really beautiful and eye catching. The staff is very friendly and helpful. We enjoyed a lot.",Positive

"I and my wife visited the hotel with high expectations for our anniversary. The moment I stepped into the room I was confused and upset to see that it was not the room that we booked. We selected the deluxe king room because it looked cozy for us and it had a jacuzzi and a balcony. But the management had upgraded us to a suite with a separate huge living room I mean I'm happy for the upgrade but use your brain why would two couples on their anniversary require a huge living room which is ok for 2 families. We wanted the original room we booked as we wanted a cozy room and not a huge room and also I wanted the balcony area to be there. After we requested we had to wait for almost 1 1/2 hrs in the room without moving around because of the covid-19. That part we understand but the butler who came to pick up our luggage didn't even inform us that we had to go to the reception to find our new room. I had to use my own phone and call the reception to see what we needed to do.
In the new room that we got, the jacuzzi was not working properly and the remote was also not working. Plus the trip switch went off once.
I had requested the complimentary anniversary cake to be delivered during the dinner which we didn't receive. Although a couple next to us received a cake. So when I talked to the management we found out that the cake was mistakenly given to the wrong couple!!! and they will send another cake to our room if we wanted one at least use your brain why don't you keep it and give it as a surprise for the breakfast. After being upset about this we came back to our room around 9 pm. At about 10.30 pm we received the cake to our room without even a candle.
The dinner was not that great. The meat items had no salt or properly seasoned. The breakfast and lunch were average.
The whole area there so much animal poop and not even cleaned. Only thing is that the precautions for the covid-19 were properly followed.
Totally disappointed and the worst place on earth.",Positive

The sceneries were really nice and the greenly effect was breathtaking. All the views from the hotel was really nice. When dining also you can get a seat closer to the window, so that you can see the lake and the surrounding while eating. The precautions for the covid-19 was properly followed.

I had really high expectations of the hotel when we were coming to the place but left being disappointed. My friends and relatives had been to this hotel for several times and they were disappointed to hear what happened to us as well.",Positive

Hotel is a bit old but well maintained. Staff was very professional and helpful. Checking is hassle-free as they already had ut ID info and forms are filled.  Rooms were already arranged when we arrive.
The buffet was nicely arranged and the food was delicious. There are several live stations and they are excellent. I stayed in a Suite room as I have 3 kids. That was perfectly planned for a family. Wonderful will and a nice bathroom with jacuzzi.
Garden was well maintained and walking in surrounding and near Kandalama tank is an amazing experience.
We all love the stay and definitely come again.",Positive
Plaese mind that both sigiriya and pidurangala are closed at the moment. Since that we were so early than the checkin time. But the hotel staff were kind enough to provide an early checkin for us without a hassitation. Anyway the hotel it self has a lot to be seen rather than going outside. You will be provided buffet for all three meals and it was also a delight.,Positive

"We checked in during the time where the hotel had very small number of guests due to covid-19 situation in the country. But the hotel staff welcomed us with the same hospitality and generosity. From the check-in to the dinning to the departure, the staff was very courteous and was well behaved according to the health guidelines issued under pandemic conditions. The General Manager him self welcomed us and rest assured that the hotel is a very safe place to enjoy our stay.

There was around 5 families were there during our stay of the weekend on half board basis, not needed to say the number of occupants were less than 20, but to our amazement there was a full fledged buffet for both Dinner and Breakfast! The quality and the selection of the food was excellent and above our expectations. It seemed that the Hotel management was well considerate of maintaining brand Kandalama stands for and the standard of the hotel even during these difficult times.

We had a little chat with the staff members as well and they informed that they are on a rotation of 14 day work shifts, where the number of staff is managed to serve the guests without cutting them off from the job. This was a nice thing to hear!

All in all, a remarkable stay and a great dining experience (both in-room and buffet) for us. Kudos to Heritance Kandalama Team!",Positive

Had number of choices including western and Sri Lanka dishes. Food quality and teasty was well above the satisfaction. Dinner and breakfast was also the same.

"Went there to spend a peaceful weekend away from the busy life and had a great time. This was my first time at Kandalama and I heard lots of stories about the magnificence of the place before I go there which turned out to be true.

The hotel itself is a marvelous peice of architecture seems to be built on the sides of a small cliff. Entire building looks like it has been engulfed by the vegetation surrounding it. You could see natural rock formations even inside the hotel in some places. There is one in the swimming pool  also.

Though the hotel was pretty large with lots of open corridors with trees in close quarters, it was extremely clean. The room I got (Luxury King) was spacious and had a great view. It had a jakuzi too.

The Kanchana restaurant served all our meals. The food was good though the spread of the buffet seemed bit limited. But it was enough to fill anyone.

I need specially say something about the staff because they were excellent. The member of the staff who took us to the room gave a very detailed description of every aspect of the room. Also gave us an idea of the layout of the hotel building and even assisted us on our decision to visit Pidurangala. The restaurant staff was very efficient too. They were very attentive but not too intrusive at the same time. Everyone else who we met were also very pleasent and helpful.

Overall I had a great time. Planning to return soon.",Positive

Heritance Kandalama gave us a unforgettable experience . Good service . The lake near by the hotel gives a good scenery with Sigiriya. We ve chosen a room from Sigiriya wings.,Positive
"Room541 on 30th and 31st August and September 2020. Hotel staff is very good , excellent. But meals are not upto the expectation. This hotel had a very good name for culinary experience which was not seen today. May be different chef for preparation of Buffets which was served by them due to Covid 19 health Guidelines. Long que seen at the buffet. Very few customers were wearing Masks . Many customers not bothered about Covid Health Guidelines.

I hope this situation will come back to normal very soon.",Positive

Excellent service by Dev George and his team specially with health and safety precautions.Thank you,Positive
"I love this hotel. Been coming here since I was kid. But however this time the food was very disappointing. Yes we understand they must have redcuded the spread but thats ok. The dinner on 31 / 08 was very bad. The soup was watery , the mutton curry was extremely salty. Many other dishes were lacking taste . The breaksfast on 31st morning had a fish curry that was gone bad and I informed that person behind the counter and he completely removed it.we are were not expecting this standard from kandalama. If not for food everything else was perefct.",Negative
"A place you must visit once in your life at least.. Hats off to the designer of this hotel with minimum harm to the nature... can you imagine a hotel in the forest.. fully eco and natural view.. superb maintanance ,,neat and clean... delicious foods and varieties ... go and see the different",Positive
"Had a short stay in early August 2020. Although reached the hotel around 1 pm we had to wait till 2.45 pm to arrange the two rooms. However, despite the above delay, we had a great experience in the hotel. Never felt that we were in a building as everywhere surrounding the trees and creepers.
Great opportunity to visit during the Covid-19 period.
Suggest the management to see the  possibility of reducing the rates to local guests during normal situation as well. The management also must positively feel the support given by locals by visiting the hotel during this pandemic period where no single foreigner was visiting the hotel.
However thanks for the friendly staff too who gave us a great service.",Positive

"We had a fantastic stay at this Geoffrey Bawa designed, uniquely beautiful hotel which is a living example for maestro's excellent architectural work.
On arrival we had a free upgrade to Delux Room with Jacuzzi which gave us a breathtaking view from room balcony over Kandalama Lake and Sigirya, amazing at sunset.The hotel is built around the rock,nestled in nature, monkeys roaming around with relaxing atmosphere also having a natural Kaludiya Pokuna pool on 6th floor. There were so many viewpoints in every corner of this iconic building  and each gave magnificent sceneries.
Rooms were clean,spacious and comfortable with modern furniture.
The buffet had a wide spread and the foods were delicious.
Staff was excellent, very friendly and attentive.
We loved every minute of our fabulous stay and definetly will come back for another stay. üòç",Positive

"The hotel itself is absolutely gorgeous, location is everything here. Unfortunately we are here during the post COVID 19 era so the food situation is a bit annoying cause we gotta ask to be served everything at the buffet individually. But it's understandable considering the circumstances and good to know that the hotel is following proper health guidelines.",Positive
Green palace,Positive
"Magnificent building by Geoffrey Bawa. The building was created not damaging the natural rock or the tress surrounded. So the building from it's Dambulla wing to Sigiriya wing has about 1km distance inside. The building is faced kandalama lake when you go upstairs of the building it gives an exceptional panoramic view from the rooms.
The resort has 6 or 7 pools.
The food is really tasty. One of the best meals you can experience in Sri Lanka.
Staff is friendly services are good.
Other than few minor incidents we faced there the stay was nice and relaxing..
P.s. you can ride bikes in the gravel road.",Positive
Perfect location for a getaway! Surrounded by the forest. Food was amazing and the staff was very friendly. Look out for offers as they frequently put out offers.,Positive

Had a great stay just after the edge of Corona with my family. This is the perfect beauty of nature. Every corner is beautiful in this building. A very iconic building. A must visit for all the architects. You'll surely enjoy l! It's a breathtaking experience. Great service! Loved everything about this building! Thanks for the hospitality and great service you did,Positive
Place is great .the surrounding environment and rooms are eye catching....but we booked a suit and it was never as we saw on their web other than that the food is vary tasty and the staff is very friendly.,Positive

Beautiful place and courteous staff. Had a wonderful 3 days stay.,Positive
"Five star service and friendly staff,
Nice nature resort , tasty food and special thing is you can feel the nature",Positive
Very poor customer care they gave given us. Dirty swimming pool as well.,Negative
"My favourite part of our stay here was the monkeys outside our balcony; the pools and the natural rock features. The food was great and impressive at how much choice there was. However, we paid $800NZD ($500USD) for one night and that is far too expensive for what it was. It was nice, but not that nice. I understand, it‚Äôs not cheap running a place like this but even so, very expensive. The photos online on booking.com of the rooms looks a lot better than what it looks like in real life, so it‚Äôs quite deceiving. We were disappointed when we opened the door to our room. It was not as great as we were expecting judging from what we had seen on the website. The room was small and the decor is old fashioned and very 90s/retro. It needs a revamp to be more modern, especially if you are charging so much, make it worth it.",Positive
Lovely place in a beautiful quiet setting. One of the best hotels in Sri Lanka,Positive
"Excellent location. Magnificent architecture. It is indeed a place worth visiting. The staff is very friendly and the restaurant serves a great variety of food. The chefs at the live stations do a really good work. Rooms are very clean, comfortable, spacious and the view from the rooms of Kandalama lake is really a breathtaking one!",Positive
Exellent,Positive
"Compared to the five-star city, the facilities are old. Also the swimming pool. The view is just too good. However, the reason why it is still the best hotel for me is the flock of hundreds of white birds that flew away from the lake at sunset, the deer I met on a morning walk, and the space itself created by Jeffrey Bawa. Many lodge hotels in Africa have been in the great outdoors, but the sense of Jeffrey Barr who brought nature into human space can only be felt here.",Positive
"Unfortunately the experience that I had in December 2019 while on Honeymoon was no where close to 5 star experience. The staff and management was great. The architecture of the hotel is unique and amazing. We were upgraded to a Suite. However, the room was dusty and unclean. The windows had cob webs and was not clean. So couldn't enjoy the view from the suite. Also the smell wasn't that pleasant in the room. The food was not at its best either except for the Sri Lankan dishes. It was not the same Kandalama hotel that I have experienced many times before my last visit. I was really disappointed because it has been one of my favorite hotels since childhood. Hope this feedback would be taken as a positive in terms of bringing back the same Kandalama Hotel experience I used to know.",Positive
"It is a hotel designed and built in a nature-friendly way, overlooking the Kandamala Reservoir. Animals such as monkeys and birds can be seen around the corridors, and the vines of plants cover the building, giving it a different atmosphere. The interior of the room is maintained in an eco-friendly way rather than flashy, so it has a clean and warm atmosphere. Please note that the veranda windows must be locked. Otherwise, monkeys and the like may cause chaos and things may be lost. You can meet animals up close, so you need to be careful and do not feed them. The attached photo was taken of the reservoir from the hotel hallway. It is recommended to stay once.",Positive
There is no other place like this in Sri Lanka.,Positive
Beautiful architecture in a unique location. You live in the middle of the jungle and can observe wild animals every day. Very good food.,Positive
A hotel in harmony with nature. In the morning I woke up with the chirping of birds.,Positive
"Cool place, wow!",Positive
"Honeymoon in 2001, a long time has passed but I still remember the beauty of the place and the friendliness of the people!",Negative
"Kandalama hotel is one of the Bawa‚Äôs last hotel designs, commencingin 1992 and opening in 1995. The 162 room Five-star hotel is located at the edge of an ancient tank or reservoir beside a rocky outcrop near Dambulla.

The entire hotel building are masked in a blanket of vegetation and the hotel are design on a platform which allowing a continuous flow of stream, wildlife and vegetation underneath the building. In addition natural rock formation was incorporated in the design which can be seen in the corridor of the hotel.

The hotel provides free Eco Park tour for guests, public and local school groups as environmental education initiatives. The Eco park consist of waste separation centre, a sewage treatment plant, plant nursery, herbal garden, eco museum & library and recycled waste paper making area using elephant dung.",Positive
Another great design done by Geoffrey Bawa,Positive
"This place is astonishing and pretty much perfect. The setting is mindblowing, you're surrounded by the most beautiful landscape (lake, mountains, trees). The most stunning wildlife, with monkeys everywhere going about their business whilst the hotel lives in their habitat and the buffet dinner and breakfast are both incredible with such variety and everything was so tasty. Better thann most a la carte restaurants! The only small quibble is their taxi service they offer, must more expensive than a locally sourced taxi. I used dambullataxis .com who were much cheaper, offered a really great bespoke service with whatsapp access to reuse and contact for more uses.

I can't rate this place highly enough. I can't wait to return.",Positive

"If You like modernist architecture: This is a must-go location. Geoffrey Bawa, the architect ist one of the worldwide renowned representative of tropical modernisms. Excellent service on top of all this beauty.",Positive
"We had an unforgettable stay at Heritance Kandalama! The hotel is a perfect part of the jungle thanks to it's unique architecture. What we loved and appreciate is your awareness of the environment by i.e. avoiding plastic and allowing wildlife to use the building as part of their jungle. Breakfast was fantastic & the staff was always super friendly and attentive without exception. We learned about Sri Lankan history and tradition at the pool, had an unforgettable candle light dinner and beautiful bird watching.
This place was definately one of the highlights of our visit to Sri Lanka and we give 100% recommendation to visitors that appreciate nature but don't want to miss the feeling of luxury!",Positive
"Very nice rooms, spacious and well laid out. (except the small white fridge placed on a piece of furniture like that, not integrated, not very design:( )

"We had the pleasure of staying here for 3 nights as part of our honeymoon. It was truly excellent. The location is very unique and you do feel pert of the jungle, the hotel itself is very well made and eco friendly.

The hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating. The room itself was great, we even had monkeys on the patio at various points but make sure you keep your doors locked to the balcony.

The food was amazing. We had half board which included breakfast and dinner and we never got bored. The lunch options were plentiful and reasonably priced. The hotel itself wasn't too far from Sigiriya (30 mins) or safari parks (40 mins) which was great.

Would truly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dambulla, thank you so much to the team at Heritance Kandalama for making our honeymoon special!",Positive
Had an awesome time with my family. Nice food and hospitality. Great view too,Positive
"It was really a very happy place. In the hallway, you can make eye contact with monkeys, bats fly at night, birds are sleeping on the ceiling, and the vines on the terrace are wonderful and assimilated with nature, it was like heaven.",Positive
A unique property in a unique location with excellent staff. If you visit Sri Lanka and don't spend at least one night here you will never realise what you have missed. A must visit establishment.,Positive

"Stunning views, great people, amazing wildlife. 5 star cuisine. Nothing short of great!",Positive
"Nice place, though it is very 90s. Location is excellent and the spa area too. Overall, needs some freshening up though. There is still a phone next to the bathroom, which I think tells you what kind of hotel it is. Still, I would come back.",Positive
Beautiful architecture. Eco friendly hotel. Nice and beautiful swimming pools at different levels. Great view on Kandalama Lake. Friendly staff. Excellent customer care. Calm and peaceful place where you can relax and enjoy the nature. Great food with lots of local and international food varieties. Greenish environment and roof top gardens.,Positive
One of a kind jungle hideaway with 5 star facilities.  Breathtaking views across the Kandalama lake towards Sigiriya rock.,Positive
One of the best hotel in Sri Lanka.  Must to see,Positive
"One of the best, if not the best 5 star hotels in Sri Lanka designed by the renowned architect Jeffrey Bawa. The iconic feature of Heritance Kandalama is its hidden among the foliage, blending with the nature. If you are a nature lover/bird watched you are in for a treat. Apart from that the world famous Sigiriya rock fortress is also visible from here.",Positive
Astounding place with one of the best architecture of this era.,Positive
"This hotel blew all my expectations away. I‚Äôd heard that Heritance were something special when it came to hotels but this particular hotel completely changed my understanding of what‚Äôs possible when luxury and relaxation collide.
The service from the moment we arrived until we left was fantastic. Unlike the other ‚Äúfive star‚Äù hotels we visited during our time in Sri Lanka, this one took great pride in their Hotel and the experience of their guests.
Our room was super clean with an amazing view and the bathroom (jacuzzi and rainfall shower) had the most amazing view over the jungle with monkeys playing just outside visible through the massive windows.
Food and drinks were great and the buffet experience rivalled the ala carte restaurant for value and quality.
All of this was great, but the pool was one of the best in the world. The view and design was both tranquil and majestic.
If you ever get a chance to visit this hotel, do, and spend an extra night more than you plan as for us, leaving the hotel was probably one of the hardest parts of our trip to this beautiful country.",Positive
Everything is good.,Positive
Everything was amazing and the food was BRILLIANT,Positive
"Great built into the forest and the mountain. Friendly, well educated staff and good meals. Huge Resort with different areas to relax.",Positive
Excellent,Positive
Fabulous stay and hotel,Positive
Kandalama Hotel is considered one of the best hotels in the Dambla area. I got a deluxe room with a very wonderful view of the forest. This was in 2007 and I am happy with this experience at that time. The hotel is still surrounded by trees and has a swimming pool overlooking the forest as well. They warned us a lot not to open the windows so that monkeys would not enter the room,Positive
This the 6th time I've stayed at Kandalama Hotel. The first time was back around 1997 I think. It's definitely a special place. The service has remained consistently high through out the years. Even some of their other hotels cannot compete.,Positive
Really amazing property built within a eco park.   Great place to relax and unwind.,Positive
"What an awesome place, the accommodation was amazing, the food delicious, the staff were incredible and the setting is wonderful.A truly magical place that we will never forget.",Positive
"Visit 2 times to this amazing place with my office mates.

Overall its rated as 5 star.

We found the variety and standard of food to be very good also.

The breathtaking view and the minimal disturbance to nature, the superb hospitality, relaxing atmosphere and last but not least the delicious food",Positive
Best ever,Positive
"A designer hotel located in a real rainforest. It is so adapted to the environment that it can hardly be seen, maybe a little too much (the windows of some rooms are quite overgrown with vegetation). she is not angry and adapted to the guests. The only thing is that the hotel is a little neglected.",Negative

"Superb hospitality, delicious food and comfortable atmosphere",Positive
"It is a masterpiece of Sri Lanka's famous architect Geoffrey Bawa, which is always listed in guidebooks.
I stayed twice in 2017 (1 night) and 2020 (2 nights).
Located about 30 minutes drive from Sigiriya Rock, you can hear birds singing inside the hotel and feel like you are really in the forest. There is also an infinity pool, but everyone needs courage to swim just by the poolside.
The buffet-style meals are also very diverse and luxurious! There was even a chocolate fountain for dinner.
The facility itself is old, but it is a hotel I would like you to stay when you go to Sigiriya.
If possible, two nights is recommended so that you can fully enjoy your stay at the hotel. However, security has become stricter since the terrorist attacks, and there is a luggage inspection and body check at the entrance of the hotel like an airport. I also tried the spa in the hotel, but it seems to be a spa called Coco spa, which has several stores, and most of them are Indonesian estheticians.",Positive
"so wonderful, it's absolutely worthwhile staying and its restaurants are also good",Positive
Superb,Positive
One of the best hotels with best care. Great location. Food variety is great. Food taste is superb. Lovely view. All hotel rooms equipped with modern equipment. Staff is friendly. There are lots of excursions to involve with. Location blends nicely with the nature.,Positive
Superb service infastructure and fantastic food,Positive
"This could be an incredibly magical place: a design hotel by a lake that blends harmoniously with nature. And in fact, a lot is done to make the stay special: a flute player to accompany the sunset, a traditional music group to ring in the evening, a pretty little spa, an infinity pool overlooking the lake...
Nevertheless, the hotel weakens in a few crucial areas:
The service is slow in many places and not very service oriented.
The tea is an impertinence (and in one of the main tea countries in the world!)
The crockery is old-fashioned and partly of inferior quality.
Regional tonic water is served - which is undrinkable and spoils every gin.
All of that would be tolerable in a simple 3*** hotel - but here the demands (and price!) and details don't go together.
In terms of location, I would like to stay - but the general conditions are not right...",Positive
"A wonderful week, totally recommended, it is a true paradise ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",Positive
"Just stunning and one of the most unique places I have ever stayed . The hotels architecture is simply just amazing. The Hotel staff is incredible - service excellence at its best. I work for 15 years in hospitality and could stay at lots of nice places, but this hotel has a very special place in my heart. The only thing i regret is, that i could only stay for two nights. I think, this was the  best hotel i have ever stayed - i am in love with the architecture, location and the people who work there, who made our sray very special ü•∞",Positive
"Again, we enjoyed another project of famous Architecture Geoffrey Bawa, hotel is built in a jungle on a big Rocky Mountain. Welcomed you are a lot of monkey. The hotel is at a stage of art. Very nice scenery and very special atmosphere. Service is very good. Breakfast is excellent. Many choices. The swimming is is excellent, natirally made by stone. Super luxury hotel. We definitely return this place again with our daughter.",Positive
No place to match in sri lanka.  Great  place,Positive

Architect Geoffrey Bawas masterpice. Timeless tranquility between the forest and the lake.,Positive
"This hotel practice several environmental friendly practices
And the architecture of this hotel Mr Geofry Bawa has paid more attention to this hotels eco friendly design",Positive
"Nice hotel, lovely setting and amazing building. Staff were great and breakfast was perfect. Dinner in the a la carte restaurant was a little expensive and quite average. Room felt a little dated - e.g. aircon/fan/lights controlled from a panel of knobs and switches behind the bed. Views over the lake from some rooms are incredible.",Positive
It's the best üíì I will definitely stay someday üíó,Positive
"Not the finest hotel. Not a modern hotel. You will be disappointed if you compare it with the finest resort hotels in Hawaii, the Mediterranean, etc. This is the ultimate hotel for those who can sympathize with Bawa's philosophy, the staff who try to protect that philosophy, and these. The difficulty is that you have to have a meal with a traveler from a continental nation with a history of 4000 years who can't understand the minimum dress code. Stand and eat at Buffet and leave the wreckage. People who are natural to leave. After the meal, we stood talking in the hallway while shouting loudly on the side of the children's sports day. Respect to the people of Sri Lanka.",Negative
"Built according to world renowned Jeffery Bawa's concept, in Heritance Kandalama, you may live by nature. It's one of the best places I'd recommend for someone to live by nature. Cool breeze from Kandalama lake would welcome you at the reception(It's built with such architecture. Built on a rock and inside you may find a cave too. You can step to your room through a corridor of which trees are grown both sides so you may feel that you're walking in a jungle. In the evening there'll be soothing music; It's divine when mixed with breeze from lake. Enjoy the pool on the top. Perfect wedding destination as well. Ideal for an outdoor function such as Poruwa Ceremony(A ritual in Sri Lankan culture). Even the access roads are through a jungle so beware if you drive in a night. All in all a good place to relax with good crowd.",Positive
Great locations and amazing view  but bad service.. staff needs better training and elevator smells. Over not clean for a 5 star hotel.  Definitely worth it for the price. I will not recommend to anyone. First time had experience at a 5 star hotel.,Positive
"This is a really nice hotel. Everywhere you look, you can enjoy the wonderful scenery, except for your room. Prices are cheap, so you can order and spend time at restaurants without hesitation. No matter where you cut it, it will be an expression of ""wonderful"".",Positive

Very good place to visit. One of my favourite places I have visited. This is a good place for your kids to be taken,Positive

The number of items at the New Year's gala dinner was an unbelievable food extravaganza.",Positive
Eco friendly hotel,Positive
The place itself is an experience. The magnificent creation of Architect Bawa mesmerizes us with its every details. The view from every corner is awesome. The staffs are very helpful and professional. The food is very good. The breakfast is awesome. There are set menu for lunch and both buffet and a la karte options available for dinner.,Positive

Every corner is beautiful in this building. A very iconic building. A must visit for all the architects. You'll surely enjoy l! It's a breathtaking experience. Great service! Loved everything about this building!,Positive
Great,Positive
"This is the best hotel I stayed for 3 days and 2 nights. They remember me and talk to me the whole time, and they are very kind. The cafe in front of the infinity pool on the 5th floor is very good, and the restaurant on the 7th floor is very delicious and good in the evening
Thank you for responding in Korean, saying that one of the restaurant staff worked in Korea.
I asked for slippers. Thank you so much for taking a shower robe. I want to come back to Sri Lanka because of Heritance Kandalama.",Positive

Beautiful,Positive
"It is a building that well shows the world view of ‚ÄòGeoffrey Bawa‚Äô, a representative architect of Sri Lanka. Despite the very old and outdated interior and exterior of the hotel, which is somewhat inconvenient, it provides an opportunity to deeply reflect on the human life that must be lived in nature.
The access road to the hotel, which requires a long walk, is dusty and unpaved. On the way from the entrance to the front desk, the natural bedrock reveals its dull texture and welcomes visitors. If you follow the dark hallway as if you are entering a cave, you will finally come across an open and spacious lobby. A swimming pool using bedrock as it is on the floor, a hotel covered with vines surrounded by a wide lake, and an architectural technique that exposes the steel structure itself all show Bawa's architectural perspective. (If you visit 'Bawa's House' in downtown Colombo, you can hear an explanation of where the basic composition of the hotel was conceived. Bawa said he started designing it after seeing a small sculpture of a bird spreading its wings. So, The hotel has a low floor height and stretches from side to side. Guests who do not know English sometimes complain that the circulation is long. In fact, the corridors are bizarrely long and stretched. Bars that must not have known this can help modern people accustomed to convenience to connect with nature. This is usually the general evaluation of this architecture. You will be surprised by the discerning eye of a genius architect who completed tropical modernism, a design that puts nature ahead of artificiality. That alone is reason enough to visit this hotel.
However, I wonder if there is another intention with Bar. It is well known that he was commissioned to design a hotel near Sigiria, and that he finally picked the place after touring the area himself. It is said that he tried to leave a building that can be one with nature without damaging the ruins of Sigiria. However, it is quite far from the real Sigiriya, and there are several wonderful natural environments with lakes in Sri Lanka. Perhaps Bawa wanted to tell us something by throwing Sigiriya in plain sight? That high Sigiriya, created by futile human affairs of desire and anxiety, seems to be asking whether it is necessary to go up close and climb it because it is mysterious (we all must climb to the top). The ruins above and around Sigria are already in ruins. We pay attention to the mad history of building castles on the rock rather than the topographical value of the towering rocky mountain. The war between the son who killed his father for the sake of power seizure and the brothers who risked their lives, people flock to see the rocky castle of misfortune, and hotel design clients who want to use it as a business opportunity... Why would Bawa try to keep our eyes on Sigria from so far away? At sunset, when you hang your arms on the edge of the swimming pool that seems to be connected in a straight line with the lake and look endlessly at Sigiriya, you will feel history, humans, nature, and a genius architect who wanted to master all of them (so you need to prepare a swimsuit).
It would be nice to apply for full board and stay for a few days. And when you're taking a bath in your room, a whole family of monkeys gather outside the window. It seems that the people in the forest are watching me, not me. The hotel food is of good quality and the wine list is extensive. When you return to the room after dinner, you can see that the small gap under the door is covered with a towel to prevent insects from entering. The efforts of the staff to make up for the lack of facilities with sincerity put a smile on their faces. It would be better if you stop by here before ‚Äòbefore‚Äô seeing Sigiriya.",Positive
No words. Epic from the day it was builtüëå,Positive
"The masterpiece of the world-class architect Bawa, surrounded by mountains and rivers, the scenery is boundless, and the sunset time is especially beautiful. Variety of breakfast and dinner.",Positive
Great,Positive
"The green architectural style combined with nature is very unique and tasteful, as if you are in a mysterious and moving forest. Cute little squirrels and monkeys often appear in front of you, adding infinite joy and relaxation to the holiday mood.
The meals are diverse and delicious, the aroma of BBQ is delicious and delicious, and the professional essential oil massage can quickly relieve the fatigue of travel.
The service quality of the service staff is positive and friendly. We stayed here for two nights and were very satisfied and happy.",Positive
"You must come and experience the works of Sri Lankan architects. You will not be disappointed. You can also watch the eagles swimming in the sky, and there are monkeys visiting on the balcony. Cool",Negative
A sea side hotel with excellent food and service.,Positive
"The place matches the photos on the booking site. That itself is worth the stars. Very well furnished room, though not well maintained. For an establishment of just 24 years, the age is showing. What they lack in hospitality, they make up in old world charm.",Positive

It was amazing. We spend very good time in the property.,Positive
"Beautiful location and atmosphere. There was a wonderful variety of food at the buffet. The Sri Lankan buffet was excellent and delicious. However, the checkin process was slow although we arrived on time. Staff is not all that friendly. We were given a double room although we booked a triple room and it was not spacious and neither did they provide requisites for three people. We had to inform the room service several times to get this sorted out.",Positive
Excellent service you will be have in here.,Positive
Excellent ..,Positive
"The dinner restaurant was so crowded that I had to wait in another room for a long time. There was no staff to check the availability of seats in the entire restaurant, so I had to walk around looking for vacant seats with the female staff who guided me.
The seat I was guided to had a small table and the aisle was very narrow. If you leave your seat as it is, someone will take your seat, and you can't even choose a dish together. It looked very nice on the homepage, but it was completely different. It was a poor service that is unheard of in a Japanese hotel, but none of the local staff seem to think it's bad. If you expect the level of Japan, you will be hurt in Sri Lanka. It was a mistake to expect that it would be fine because it is a luxury hotel.",Negative

"This hotel is located 8 km from Dambulla, Sri Lanka. It was built with nature-friendly and eco-friendly ideas on the shores of Lake Gandalamar. Named one of the 300 Best Hotels in the World, . It is the work of a world-renowned Sri Lankan designer named 'Jeffrey Bawa'. As it is located in the central area of ‚Äã‚Äãmajor tourist attractions such as historical places such as Adarapura, Aukana, Polonnaruwa, Sigiriya, and Dambulla Grottoes, it is worth experiencing accommodations.",Positive
"Amazing scenery with Kandalama Lake and Sigiriya in the horizon. The suite was cosy and had ample amenities. Good WiFi. The beds were super comfy and the view from the suite was just priceless.
We ordered in-room dining for dinner, which was delivered in about 25 minutes. The breakfast buffet had both western and Sri Lankan options, with cooks preparing local dishes as requested.
The staff was well-mannered and friendly, ever ready to answer our questions. There's a spa as well but we didn't check it out.",Positive

"Incredible hotel. So unique and such a great experience. It was like living in Jurassic park but with a posh and comfortable twist.

Service was great.
You can watch monkeys from your room and at breakfast time.

Infinity pool overlooking the lake was sensational.

You can also hike sigryia rock from here.",Positive

But... Hopefully their gonna renovate the structure as soon as possible
The Gym was not practicable.
We will come back üòä",Positive
"From a mobility perspective there are ramps and elevator's to get between floors. However, there didn't appear to be any mobility accessible rooms. For a more mobile wheelchair user the rooms could work but there are no grab rails, shower seat etc.
Overall the staff were very friendly and helpful, food was delicious and atmosphere very relaxing.",Positive
"An excellent hotel, designed by world renowned Sri Lankan architect Geoffrey Bawa in such a way that surrounding nature has minimal disturbance. Should be seen to be believed, it is really unique in this respect. Apart from that, a very good five star hotel with excellent food, nice swimming pools, breath taking scenery from rooms of Kandalama lake and also the adjoining forest and distant mountain ranges.",Positive
"Food was very expensive and staff was horrible. Balcony, outdoor area and top swimming pool were not clean. Parking available under tree but they said they can't take any responsibility for vehicle if it damaged by animals or bad weather so I really disappointed.",Negative

"The hotel design and ambience is amazing. Secluded from locality and surrounded by nature. The staffs are really nice too. Except few issues the hotel is amazing for a vacation. There were no power outlets to charge mobiles, we had to take out the lamp sockets to charge our phones. Few occasional power cuts bt stays bout a minute or two. Not much entertainment facilities either.",Positive
One of the best hotels in sri lanka with the perfect environmental surrondings within the premises. This time in the year would be more perfect to visit this beautiful place since sudden drizzles falling in to lush wild green. It was perfect weather in this time of the year in kandalama to discover its true beauty. Food and service levels were truly satisfying and the beauty of the location was breathtaking. Highly recomended for your vacation.,Positive
It was a nice stay. Very friendly staff.  Rooms was clean and comfortable. Food was excellent. For dinner need to come in smart casual. Need to close the balcony door always as small insects may come in side.,Positive
"This is one of the famous hotels in Sri Lanka designed by Geoffrey Bawa, one of the famous architects in Sri Lanka. The hotel is in a forest and provides a good view of the Kandalama lake. You find monkeys everywhere who will not hesitate to enter your room if the doors are kept opened (they had entered and taken some food when we visited last time as we had forgotten to keep the doors closed). If you are a nature lover, this hotel will probably attract you.

Food had an adequate variety though we felt it was less than our previous visit about 2 years back, especially the dinner. The staff of the hotel was good. Rooms were comfortable and clean though no dental and shaving kits were available in the washroom.
I had a bitter experience when I wanted to modify the reservation made for my family as I later realised that I should have ideally booked a double room with two children (aged 6 & 8) instead of a triple room. However, after taking two days, they refused this saying no modifications are allowed under the scheme. When I expressed my disappointment also, they were still mentioning my original reservation prevailed. It lacked courtesy too (we altogether reserved 4 rooms but one member couldn‚Äôt come. Even then, we didn‚Äôt make a request to change/modify it as we understood it would not be fair to make such request, given the conditions). This attitude and treatment of the management greatly disappointed me before the arrival.  So, be perfect with your reservation, if you intend staying here and other Aitken Spence hotels.

In terms of value for money, there are much better options.  There are much better hotels/resorts by established and famous brands which will give you more value for money, flexibility and even go an extra mile to keep you happy. There is another resort managed by one of the famous and established brands close by, in Habarana (didn‚Äôt mention the name of the resort due to doubts on the disclosure) which has a great greenery environment with a better food variety (from salads to desserts with many action stations) and excellent customer service for a lesser price, giving excellent value for money.",Positive
It's really 5 star hotel and you can feel it from the check in to out,Positive
Brilliant,Positive
Here is very nice hotel. Great views make me happy ang feel close up to nature.,Positive

"Though we booked a triple room, after they accompanied us to the room they have not arranged it as a triple room. After half an hour they arranged the bed but not others. We had to asked separately mug, glass, towel, etc. each and every time we need same. They informed us that the room was ready when we were at our lunch table. They have to check everything before informing us since we didn't even rush them.",Negative
"Upon check-in, my partner and I were informed that there had been an error on our booking meaning the room had been booked for one guest only, despite booking a Deluxe Room and mailing the property ahead of time requesting 2 Twin beds. The hotel admitted no responsibility for this miscommunication and had zero empathy, I was quite upset although I was understanding that a solution must be found. Imagine my surprise when the hotel representative then demanded an additional $100 per night ($200 in total - essentially the cost of a second room), despite no further consumables being used for 2pax than there is for 1pax - bearing in mind this is on a ROOM ONLY basis. The room was prepared, and adding a second person to a room has zero impact on the hotels expenses from my first hand experience - especially as breakfast was not included. This blatant attempt at a money grab left a sour taste in our mouths,and we were disappointed by the lack of explanation provided and the antagonistic & disingenuous attitude of the front desk staff & front desk manager.",Negative
"Upon reaching our room, we were greeted with a disturbing sight. A gigantic millipede and an ant infestation greeted us as soon as we entered. While we understood that we were in a jungle setting, we had expected a '5-star' property to be able to keep simple pests at bay.",Negative
"In addition to this, the air conditioning unit in our room began to leak at 23:00 hours, causing the wooden floors to become flooded within just a few minutes. Despite multiple calls to the front desk requesting maintenance assistance, we were met with reluctance and had to call a second time to beg for someone to come to our room to fix the issue. This is not what I expect from any hotel - 1 star or 5 star. This is another example that showed a distinct lack of customer service.",Negative
"On the second day of our stay, the lady from the first dispute displayed an attitude that was sour and unwelcoming. She did not greet us, nor did she smile or offer any form of service. This was incredibly disappointing and did nothing to improve our experience. This lack of interaction was the final straw that led me to publish this review, as I had initially wanted to move past the experience and simply see the previous days check-in as a one off.However, it is worth noting that the restaurant staff were a bright spot during our stay. The restaurant manager was particularly kind and accommodating, and we thoroughly enjoyed the music provided by the flutist. We urge any future guests who do decide to choose to stay at this 'hotel' to sit outside whenever possible, as the atmosphere inside the dining hall is lacking and uninviting.",Negative
"I hope the hotel takes this as constructive criticism and sees it as an opportunity to allow for leniency when it comes to human error, such as their own booking department's failure to pick up on a key detail prior to guest arrival. It would also be beneficial for the staff to receive training on how to manage expectations & dealing with mishaps. However, I fear that this feedback may not make an ounce of difference, given that there was the opportunity to make things right at the time. This is why I felt compelled to write this review.",Negative
"Terrible hotel. This is a scam hotel not a 5-star hotel. They have not spend any money on sound proofing the hotel. You can hear everything in every room around you. All people walking by can hear, the music in the hallway can hear. There is a crack in the door. Bed and blankets are terrible. I really wish I can have my money back and my time as I didn't sleep at all. Really horrible. Do not come if you are annoyed by loud sounds and terrible bed.",Negative
I could not believe it and was disappointed. They vacuumed and changed the bed linen only after I informed the room is dusty. It kept me worrying about the safety at pandemic times. I enjoyed everything else. I love this place but this is the first and last visit here. My kids told me the same.,Negative
The 3rd bed of the 3 pax room is not to the standards. room facilities should be improved. Meal variety should be improved to match the 5-star standard. but the hotel is the most beautiful hotel I have ever visited,Negative
We were in a presidential suite and the way the room was taken care of was shocking The wallpapers to the bed headboard is ripping and the spa inside the room wasn't been even tested for sometime,Negative
"I think the hotel ratings should be reviewed again for this hotel. Because 5 star is not suitable for this anymore. Everyone talks about its glory and the architecture because a famous architect built this hotel. However, hotel staff doesn't care about guests and they have enormous ego. The staff is not friendly and nice. We got a panaromic king room. The room was small and old. Commod was not cleaned (Check the attached picture). The furniture were not comfortable. There were not wall plugs to charge the phone near the bed. In a 5 star hotel there should be a iron for every room. But this hotel rooms are not equipped with irons and when we requested, they rejected our request. We had to argue with them to get an iron.",Negative
"Last but not least, the food is average. But the main point is they don't follow covid guidelines at the restaurant. The restaurant was full with people. When we got our cutleries, there was a hair inside. They didn't even apologize for their mistake. Amidst the covid pandemic, this hotel doesn't even clean these things well. There are better 5 star hotels for cheaper price near this hotel. I would not recommend this hotel at all.",Negative
"It was not a good experience as others views it. It was so crowded and had fewer staff to support guest arrivals. A lot of guests waited more than one hour to check in. We were allocated 2 floors which is the basement. We requested higher rooms at any price but it was not materialized. Finally, we decided to change the hotel to another. We may be the few guests who turn back from this kind of 5-star hotel. Although there were good comments, it was not well organized and need more staffs to be employed. Will see again with good hopes...",Negative
When you book rooms please ask the level or floor of the rooms. If you get 2 and 3 floors .. you don’t have view and dark view. Entrance side only rock. I think better to select from 4th floor and above.,Negative
"Strangely unpleasant place. Food 4/5. Room 3/5. Check in experience 0/5. Service 2/5. Value for money 1/5. Even if offered a free suite, I would never go back. A bad hotel can have a good view and still be a bad hotel. Most of the reviews are fake, notice how many of the reviewers have only written 2 reviews for example.",Negative
My recent experience at Heritance Kandalama was very disappointing.,Negative
"To begin with, we've reserved for a panoramic view room and as per the description on their website the room offers a panoramic view of the kandalama lake and the dambulla rock. Whereas; our room's view was obstructed by the trees so barely had the said view. I brought this into the staffs attention and their response was they do not cut tress and the website still contains old pictures. They were not ready to relocate us to a better room either. So beware: the pictures are deceiving and you wouldn't get a solution for your concerns from the staff. We have paid for a view that was existed many years ago.",Negative
Horrendous experience! My husband and I were travelling around Sri Lanka on our honeymoon in August and kandalama had to be on the list because of all the good memories but it's not the same kandalama we used to know!,Negative
"HORRIBLE service - check in process took forever, staff was gloomy, and not helpful.",Negative
We wanted to extend our stay purely based on the beauty of the hotel and we were treated so poorly by the head receptionist who made very rude comments about us being locals when we were inquiring.,Negative
They've hired trainees from hotel schools who have not been trained properly by the managers at kandalama or given proper information. I don't blame the trainees as they were trying their best to fix the situation after failing but the head receptionist (Prasanna - I might have the wrong name) was so rude to us we've never experienced such horrible service in our lives!,Negative
So sad to see one of our favourite resorts since childhood in such poor state. I did not want to stay there a minute longer so we left and they tried to compensate by giving us some free jam on our way out _____________________,Negative
BOTTOM LINE - SPEND YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE,Negative
"1)Late checking (2 hours delay).
2)Given a wrong room and washroom is not cleaned well.found insects in the washroom.
3)Food is excellent.
I would never come again.(rather staying at home and chill)",Negative
"While the staff is courteous, they are quite disorganized. We checked in and went straight for lunch as our room wasn't ready. Given we are traveling with an infant, we requested a baby cot in our room. After lunch there was no one to direct us to the room. We had to walk back to the reception to get someone to walk us to the room. Even though it's been over an hour since we checked in at this point, our luggage wasn't brought to the room for another 10 minutes - and a cot was nowhere to be seen. Had to re-request and wait for over an hour, the reception doesn't answer the phone.. etc. etc.
While the hotel itself is nice, the service is far from it.
UPDATE: We had a hot water flask in our luggage, and it's shattered into pieces. Either they threw our bag or dropped it.
Baby cot arrived after eventually getting through to reception and requesting again.
TERRIBLE SERVICE",Negative
"Terrible hotel. This is a scam hotel not a 5-star hotel. They have not spend any money on sound proofing the hotel. You can hear everything in every room around you. All people walking by can hear, the music in the hallway can hear. There is a crack in the door. Bed and blankets are terrible. I really wish I can have my money back and my time as I didn't sleep at all. Really horrible. Do not come if you are annoyed by loud sounds and terrible bed.",Negative
"Horrible experience!
Nothing went well in this hotel. The experience was horrible, and I consider it the worst hotel I stayed at on my journey to Sri Lanka. Moreover, the room was not clean and there was a spider nest in one of the tables.",Negative
"Disliked · 1- You have to take off-road for about ten minutes to reach the hotel.
2- The internet is super slow where you can barely use WhatsApp or any other instant messages apps. It is super slow to the limit you can not use google sometimes.
3-The insects and bats are everywhere. To go to the restaurant you have to pass by three bats flying at the entrance of the restaurant. In addition, there was a lizard inside the restaurant next to our table. It was an unpleasant experience at all having dinner at the restaurant.
4- The staff of the restaurant was unprofessional and unfriendly at all. One of them gave us the bill to pay for it and once I told him my booking was half-board he replies rudely you have to pay for the drinks. He could simply be polite and reply "" sorry sir, but half-board booking does not include beverages"". In addition, I asked him for napkins and he gave them to me as like he wants to hit me.
5-The next day, I ordered breakfast to have in my room. I had to wait 45 minutes for the room services to bring it. Unfortunately, when I told the guy I waited for you for 45 minutes he replied "" 45 minutes!!!"" and then looked at his phone as he didn't believe me and then replied impolitely "" oh yes 45 minutes sorry"". Is this an appropriate method to treat the residents?
5-Due to the bad experience at the restaurant, the next day I wanted to have dinner in my room",Negative
"However, this was an unpleasant experience again. After waiting so long for the dinner, the guy came and to be honest he was polite, but he brought a bill with him and I told him my booking is half-board so the dinner should be included. I called the room services and they told me rudely that half-board booking is only at the restaurant so if you want to have your dinner in the room you have to pay for it! so I asked them to call the manager and he replied I will call him and back to you.",Negative
"Don’t waste your money on this buffet. We weren’t staying here but came for dinner, excited about the prospect of a 5 star hotel buffet. It was extremely underwhelming and low quality especially considering the price (LKR 60,000/person). We would happily pay that for quality food and variety (like the buffet at Jetwing Lake, which was far superior and also cost less) but most of the selection here lacked flavor and was also not prepared fresh- grilled prawns for example, which could easily be grilled in the wok to order, sat cooked and waiting to be picked up. The service was good but this was a massive disappointment. There were a few highlights (chicken curry for one) but absolutely nothing that warrants the price and overall certainly does not live up anywhere near to the expectation. Save yourself the disappointment and go to the buffet at Jetwing Lake!",Negative
"I have been into Heritance Kandalama 12 times with my family. We planned to bring our brother family but as per their hotel rules they consider them as foreigners. If that’s the case they should state it at the beginning itself. We were 8 of us travelled together, and wasted our hrs of day saying back and forth talking their high authorities
I will never come back to Heritance kandalama again in my life
We walked out of the hotel without staying over at Heritance Kandalama",Negative
"
My family and I visited this hotel expecting a world class experience. But we are utterly disappointed with the bitter experience we received. We checked in by 2.00 pm and had to wait till 5.00 pm to get to our rooms and baggages. The food was fairly good but is very underrated than the quality it is said to be. Though the staff was friendly it was not a very pleasant experiences. Being a family with minors, we had to undergo great difficulties. Please improve these grey areas in your service. We are not hoping to visit this hotel anytime soon.",Negative
"We thought a heritance kandalama is the best resort hotel for honeymooners and for others. yep, I think it was. But so sad to say totally collapsed.Cockrochers and flyies at nigt comes inside while windows closed ,Main problem there is no responsible staff in housekeeping.Because cockrochers legs were inside of the shower gel bottle. I feel they did not clean properly evrything inside in room . But i need to say great view and they were providing very tast food.this was after lockdown.we faced last month.______",Negative
Had one the worst front desk experience I have ever experienced at Kandalama. Reception staff was very non welcoming... and I was honestly shocked to see such behaviour from a reputed chain as aitken spense. Completely abandoned my enthusiasm to book the place in few minutes. Im glad most of the guys dont do bookings in person. Im pretty sure it wont cross zero.,Negative
Also hotel is poorly maintained might not worth ur extra buck. High time management fix those.,Negative
"Wanted to state how I got an extremely unprofessional way from” Sanjeewa” at the reception as I wanted a 2-3 hours late checkout but he was an unwelcoming and very offensive.
How sad that a hotel like this hire such people.
I guess all this is that because I didn’t use the taxi that he referred to which is X 200 times more expensive than the normal ones.
And the star that I put is for the look from inside the room that many will like.",Negative
"Very much disappointed about the state of the rooms and overall service and extended to us tourists during our stay on 02.04.2021 to 04.04.2021
We felt like the hotel is giving us favour in staying at the hotel, which is not the case.
If the management and hotel staff don't like local tourists visiting the hotel, please don't open it local tourists.
But don't forget during tough times in the local travel industry, it was always the local tourists that kept the hotels going on.
Please take this comments positively and improve the overall service",Negative
"One of the worst experience ever. I even regret the fact that I actually booked this hotel for a short holiday. I enjoyed quarantine hotel (Amari Galle) than Kandalama. Your staff is rude. Especially the kitchen stewards. The steward who served me Curd and Bee honey was absolutely rude. I asked him for bee honey and he was like ""you want pickle?"". Then I said I want honey and then he said pickle and honey is the same thing :D. This is definitely not a 5 star hotel. Hospitality is very low. I didn't feel that I actually went for a luxury hotel but a community center. Not gonna recommend to any of my friends. And why people wearing gown and other eastern clothing to the pool ? Hilarious.",Negative
"NOT RECOMEND if you expect a good customer service from this hotel. The atmosphere is good. So if you really want to enjoy Geoffrey Bawa's architecture, forget about getting good customer service, from here. I have an extremely unpleasant experience and will not choose this hotel again. From the entrance I felt that we were unwelcomed.",Negative
"Keeping that aside at the dinner time they didn't let us to enter the hall. Reason was our attire was not suitable for the dinner hall. The lady who was there at entrance informed me that only smart casual attire is accepted and that was mentioned in the terms and conditions which I did not read. After telling that she left. So we were waiting there thinking what to do because No one gave an alternative. After waiting some time I again went to that lady and asked since we're not allowed to have the dinner inside, what is the solution for this. To be honest She totally ignored us. She said if you want we can deliver the food to the room. Take the food from the buffet and keep on a table. That's what she said exactly. We were actually surprised on her behavior and this weird situation.",Negative
Then I asked if you cant let us to dine in can you arrange a table outside. Because there were tables outside also. She said that's also impossible. Only option was having the dinner inside the room. So we put the plates where she told to put and waited. They took around 35/40 minutes to bring that food to the room and food was cold.,Negative
"Even we wanted to try some other food it was annoying to go there asking permission to enter and requesting them to bring the food to the room. This is the worst experience I have ever got in a Sri Lankan Hotel. I have traveled all over the country, stayed in many hotels, so far I never had such a bad experience. Heritance Ahungalla customer service is awesome comparing to this. I emailed to the management about this experience and they never accept any of these and they were like it was all my fault",Negative
" My points are,
1.If there is a dress code they could highlight it. Because people never expect such a situation. They are going out of Colombo. Its a trip. Not a business meeting. But if it is the hotel standard and I respect it. But there should be a alternative and staff should be polite to the guest. Guest are coming, paying to the hotel to enjoy their vacation not to get STRESSED.
2.If any of guests come with a normal t shirt and a short the management can explain the rules nicely and arrange outside table to enjoy the meal which is fair to the guest. But the staff who were in the dining hall never bothered to do so even after my request.
However the email from the management also saying that the fault is not their and it is impossible to happen something like that. But I personally faced to this situation and I felt embarrassed at that moment. My whole vacation was ruined by that incident.",Negative
I and my wife visited the hotel with high expectations for our anniversary. The moment I stepped into the room I was confused and upset to see that it was not the room that we booked. We selected the deluxe king room because it looked cozy for us and it had a jacuzzi and a balcony. But the management had upgraded us to a suite with a separate huge living room I mean I'm happy for the upgrade but use your brain why would two couples on their anniversary require a huge living room which is ok for 2 families. We wanted the original room we booked as we wanted a cozy room and not a huge room and also I wanted the balcony area to be there. After we requested we had to wait for almost 1 1/2 hrs in the room without moving around because of the covid-19. That part we understand but the butler who came to pick up our luggage didn't even inform us that we had to go to the reception to find our new room. I had to use my own phone and call the reception to see what we needed to do.,Negative
"In the new room that we got, the jacuzzi was not working properly and the remote was also not working. Plus the trip switch went off once.
I had requested the complimentary anniversary cake to be delivered during the dinner which we didn't receive. Although a couple next to us received a cake. So when I talked to the management we found out that the cake was mistakenly given to the wrong couple!!! and they will send another cake to our room if we wanted one at least use your brain why don't you keep it and give it as a surprise for the breakfast. After being upset about this we came back to our room around 9 pm. At about 10.30 pm we received the cake to our room without even a candle.
The dinner was not that great. The meat items had no salt or properly seasoned. The breakfast and lunch were average.
The whole area there so much animal poop and not even cleaned. Only thing is that the precautions for the covid-19 were properly followed.
Totally disappointed and the worst place on earth.",Negative
Nice hotel; but the service is not so good.. be careful if you ask information over the phone. Pretty irresponsible management,Negative
Staffs were friendly and helpful but big nuisances with the monkeys over there__,Negative
Beautiful hotel under the poor management.Do not go there with valuable properties.They can be stolen and gone under the account of poor monkeys around the hotel..,Negative
There is a good view but still the service given by the staff is unsatisfactory. You have to go to the buffet as soon as possible if not you have to wait in the queue to take your meal. Most of the staff members are acting like they're paying for your stay. Some staff were really good. Apart from the view and the infinity pool there is nothing special about this hotel. I wont go to it for the second time.,Negative
Very disappointed service just requested to arrange early check in since travelling with a baby without consideration rejects very unprofessional service being reputable hotel therefore cancelled the reservation,Negative
Nice view but not with good service,Negative
"The hotel location is good, staff is friendly, but the road to the hotel is worst, so many holes and muddy road, I don't know why it is not repaired when many vehicles on on this only road where there is no option?",Negative
"Although we paid without any card discounts ,Not experienced what I herad from my friends abount hotel.",Negative
Regret to say service is not satisfctory.,Negative
"Overly dissatisfied. Food was just edible, lots of disturbances from other guests and general maintenance of the property. The massage at the spa was of poor standards(ended with pain and bruises). Room service far of reflecting a five stars hotel. The view from the room was disappointing considering the price and location.",Negative
Heritance Kandalama must be renovated.,Negative
"Bunch of unprofessional.
Specially when going for credit card offers careful, they are not transparent and dont explain the hidden terms and conditions.",Negative
"
Lovely resort but they allow the guests to smoke in non smoking rooms ! I was upgraded to a suite which was lovely but the inhalation of stale smoke smell for a few hours flared up my asthma and wheezing v badly ! I changed rooms in the middle of the night but the damage had been done.. Several other guests complained about the same thing .. It ruined me entire 10 day trip to Sri Lanka with constant detours to a pharmacy to buy more inhalers and nasal sprays and antihistamines and has given me a bad memory ! A real shame as otherwise a beautiful resort",Negative
"
We called the hotel and reserved lunch buffet for six people. We were told there will be an international buffet. It was quite disappointing to find out buffet is not available today when we arrived there. We drove all the way from Colombo for the buffet. We complained the front manager (sanjeev) but he took neither responsibility nor any action for the inconvenience they caused us. Unacceptable!",Negative
Poor facilities in rooms. Refurbishment to be done immediately.,Negative
Found staff to be very rude and snobby. The couldn't care less about you as a customer. They also have an elephant they endorse for rides. ELEPHANTS ARE NOT FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES. SHAME ON YOU.,Negative
"Our worst hotel experience in Sri Lanka.
Mr Bawa would turn in his grave. The Xmas decorations were totally ridiculous. Building structure in very poor condition—serious lack of maintenance.
Very noisy and has completely lost its spirit of being connected to nature.
The only thing it is very connected to seems to be money. No shortage of customers. Fully booked all the time.
Go for tea, don’t waste your money staying over.",Negative
Very poor customer care they gave given us. Dirty swimming pool as well.,Negative
Telephone etiquette could improve. Very disrespectful.,Negative
Garbage.Thats all.Old tv.Bathroom is covered by a black cloth.,Negative
Poor service…,Negative
"Buildings are old. The bathroom and the fridge etc was dirty. Overall room cleanliness should be improved. In addition it is crowded. Workers are good, but normally sri lankans provide good hospitality even if you go to a village home.",Negative
" Disgusting service: on booking / and on a call they reported one price, upon arrival the price tripled. As soon as they refused, the manager dropped the price to the one that was announced when calling.
Some kind of scam, as if managers put it in their pocket. By the way, the photo does not correspond to reality. The hotel is not in the best condition",Negative
"Oh my god, it's beyond me how this hotel got 5 stars. We left again even though we had booked 2 nights. At most 3 stars. More of a youth hostel with service and a nice pool. The rooms totally shabby and warty. There urgently needs to be renovated.",Negative
The disadvantage is that they have a house elephant that can be ridden,Negative
"The dinner restaurant was so crowded that I had to wait in another room for a long time. There was no staff to check the availability of seats in the entire restaurant, so I had to walk around looking for vacant seats with the female staff who guided me.",Negative
"The seat I was guided to had a small table and the aisle was very narrow. If you leave your seat as it is, someone will take your seat, and you can't even choose a dish together. It looked very nice on the homepage, but it was completely different. It was a poor service that is unheard of in a Japanese hotel, but none of the local staff seem to think it's bad. If you expect the level of Japan, you will be hurt in Sri Lanka. It was a mistake to expect that it would be fine because it is a luxury hotel.",Negative
" First of all when we booked the rooms, we were only told it would be a double and triple superior, no other information was provided (view, which wing). Since this was our first time we didn't really ask for more information either. That maybe our fault I admit. However, for what we paid, we weren't fairly compensated for the rooms. 1) both the rooms were facing a car park. When we inquired about this we were told, for better views we had to pay more- which is fine but it's the hotels responsibility to inform us when we made the reservation. 2) both rooms the curtains were super dirty. They had huge black and brown stains. It looked like the curtains weren't washed in years. 3) the triple room the AC was leaking. Someone came to fix it but no one arrived to clean the mess despite informing the front desk. 4) the overall dismissive nature of the front desk staff about the complaints 5) the double room phone wasnt working. All in all it was quite apparent they had put us up in two run down rooms. I'm not sure if we were offered a lower price for the run down rooms or we paid the usual rates but were put up in run down rooms (I do think it's the latter). This was our experience and it wasn't a great one.",Negative
"Though we booked a triple room, after they accompanied us to the room they have not arranged it as a triple room. After half an hour they arranged the bed but not others. We had to asked separately mug, glass, towel, etc. each and every time we need same. They informed us that the room was ready when we were at our lunch table. They have to check everything before informing us since we didn't even rush them.",Negative
"They will basically hold you hostage, won’t let you get a normal taxi, will make you pay an arm and a leg for a car to get out of the hotel.",Negative
The hotel at night is basically an old folks home.,Negative
Be prepared to be woken up by screaming children at 7am. EVERYDAY!,Negative
Any tours you do will be extortionate.,Negative
The pools close super early (8pm),Negative
"Basically, if you’re a young and fun person this hotel is not for you. This hotel is for retired people.",Negative
"2 stars are only give for the very kind and attentive staff and natural views.
The rest of the hotel and the rooms are in a very poor conditions and thoroughly in need of an upgrade/refurbishment, you can tell this place hasn’t been touched since it opened decades ago.
The state of the bathrooms are the worse, cracked sinks, rusting taps and showers. Shower doors don’t shut properly so it leaks all on the bathroom floor. Black toilet. The views are meant to sell this property, but I’m not sure the last time the windows in the rooms, bathrooms and or in the restaurant were cleaned- surely these should be done regularly to make the most of the views??
The food in the restaurant is pretty terrible too, uncooked potato’s, lack of flavour in the food- we all struggled to eat for 3 days.
If you are staying here note that there is little/nothing around it unless you travel.
Overall- in desperate need a refurbishment, not 5 star standard at all. I wouldn’t stay here again.",Negative
"An amazing experience turned sour at the check out!
My family and I checked in to Herittance Kandalama for just one night, the overall experience was amazing until we checked out and went into cashier's office to make payments.
My father made the booking via an individual by the name Indunil who works at your Hotel, he failed to communicate effectively the room rates to my father and we were in for a surprise when we checked out. Apparently we were upgraded to two suites rather than double rooms for which he sent the confirmation via whatsapp to my father. The front desk also failed to communicate this at the time of checkin and consequently we were requested to pay an extra 30,000 LKR at the end. I was absolutely furious as we were not made aware of this and a hotel of such caliber failed miserably to effectively communicate to their customer the room rates. We made the payment but left with a bitter taste.
The hotel also failed to provide my wife with a band aid, that's a very simple request which the hotel failed to cater to.
I would not recommend this property to my friendly and family as we felt we were deceived.",Negative
"When arriving at the hotel, the first impression is: WOW. Located almost at the peak of a mountain, amazing views are guaranteed. But this hotel disappointed me very much. It is very outdated, the hotel only offers a few sunbeds at their pools - which is not enough to ensure everyone can relax at the pool. Considering this feedback has been given before in older reviews, it is absolutely a disgrace to their visitors that this feedback has not been having a follow up. In addition: some sunbeds definitely need to be replaced. The food in the hotel is okay, but not 5*-like. During breakfast, cheeses and yoghurts are not being cooled - which is a possible disaster given the fact that these could cause food illnesses. Every day I had to ask for cold yoghurt, because the one in the display was warm. You are wondering how they seriously take the care of their food without reach and sight of their guests. The rooms are outdated, dirty jacuzzi in the room. The room was dirty and moldy, so was the minibar. The water tap in the bath room was more than 20 years old, given the fact that chalk was all around",Negative
"I went there in few months back and the experience was not pleasant. First thing was I requested lake view room ,when did my booking and I didn't get that kinds of a room that other hotels provides that kinds of a request.",Negative
"Second thing was when i arrived to room with reception officer, Some one in the room with maintaining TV while fully sanitized sticker was in the door.",Negative
"Thirdly the booklet hotel also used one , Someone draw a picture there ,most probably the previous customer. I wondered why they didn't change it in this kind of a covid situation .",Negative
"Buffet was Terrible , Very small variant buffet and those are also not tasty .",Negative
"Hotel view and the design is really perfect. For me its not worth for money as booking charges are high, But must visit hotel in Sri Lanka",Negative
"I’m not going to blame about their location or service Bcz it was amazing.
Their food was Horrible
I ordered butter cake as my snack they gave me some kind of cake decorated with cream then I tasted it and I could feel that the cake was very old . Immediately I called the reception and complained they cancelled my bill which was good .
Next Day for the al carte menu ordered baked cheese cake as dessert
They gave me the same cake which I had last day telling me this is a baked cheese cake (actually I’m a baker) it was very bad . I felt soo bad their service was poor
Their menu also very poor need to be updated",Negative
I could not believe it and was disappointed. They vacuumed and changed the bed linen only after I informed the room is dusty. It kept me worrying about the safety at pandemic times. I enjoyed everything else. I love this place but this is the first and last visit here. My kids told me the same.,Negative
"Kandalama Kandalama Kandalama.
I have booked this for my parents as a gift. Mmm check in was bit messy. They were Really disappointed about the reception service and also reservations department. (Requested for a room with better view. But they have chosen a room with a view of outdoor washrooms. Super dissatisfied! When my parents said that they won’t stay in there, then they had given a better room with a nice view. But why can’t they give it without disappointing them. Even no welcome drink for them. Hmmmmm.)
Please don’t do this to any one.
But then all were good. Super Resturant service and every other people were very helpful and nice. Location and everything earns 6 stars. ____________
But reception and reservations made it into ____
Disappointing! But cheers for others!",Negative

The sceneries were really nice and the greenly effect was breathtaking. All the views from the hotel was really nice.

I had really high expectations of the hotel when we were coming to the place but left being disappointed. My friends and relatives had been to this hotel for several times and they were disappointed to hear what happened to us as well.,Negative
very dated tired overpriced large hotel was once the crown jewel but not even competitive now good for bulk package tours probably,Negative
"meals are not upto the expectation. This hotel had a very good name for culinary experience which was not seen today. May be different chef for preparation of Buffets which was served by them due to Covid 19 health Guidelines. Long que seen at the buffet. Very few customers were wearing Masks . Many customers not bothered about Covid Health Guidelines.
I hope this situation will come back to normal very soon.",Negative
Great locations and amazing view but bad service.. staff needs better training and elevator smells. Over not clean for a 5 star hotel. Definitely worth it for the price. I will not recommend to anyone. First time had experience at a 5 star hotel.,Negative
"Won't recommend for anyother to stay in here since room amamenities are way too poor. There was no power in the room first and then the TV wasn't working.
Plus no bathroom supplies were placed even its a 5 star hotel. Had to pay for those!
One of the most terrible hotel stay ever.
Expect the food! The buffet was delicious !",Negative
"Food was very expensive and staff was horrible. Balcony, outdoor area and top swimming pool were not clean. Parking available under tree but they said they can't take any responsibility for vehicle if it damaged by animals or bad weather so I really disappointed",Negative
The check-in time was 2 pm. We were a group of 11 rooms. 5 of the rooms were delayed for 3 hours. That was really disappointing.,Negative
"Huge hotel, looked tired and dirty. Had to change rooms twice. Didn't feel welcome particularly. Food was in a very noisy area. View from the pool was good.",Negative
Very nice hotel but the food and service standards need to further improve. The check in and check out process has to take place faster. It took us close to 25 mins! Supposed to be a breakaway hotel but ends up with lots of tourist and people. The value is not really great as the food quality and varieties are really bad. The service is pretty bad as if you won’t able to pay! Food quality has to improve especially the morning juice counter just don’t know how to make a drinkable carrot juice !,Negative
"From a mobility perspective there are ramps and elevator's to get between floors. However, there didn't appear to be any mobility accessible rooms. For a more mobile wheelchair user the rooms could work but there are no grab rails, shower seat etc.
Overall the staff were very friendly and helpful, food was delicious and atmosphere very relaxing",Negative
"Sadly seen better days, could really benefit from a refurb. Service was hit it and miss (a few great staff let down by many) On the plus side the Sri Lankan buffet was excellent.",Negative
"Honeymoon package overlooked - we booked this hotel directly on their site because of their advertised honeymoon package (decorated room, chocolate platter, special candle lit dinner, discount on a couples massage etc.) but none of this was offered... Really disappointing! Even when we asked about it, no one took action. The hotel itself is very beautiful and comfortable, and the breakfast/dinner options are very good. But the service level could really step up, we found it rather slow and passive (it took nearly an hour to check in and multiple times asking what was happening), which is not what you expect from such a luxury hotel. If they get the service right, this could be a truly amazing experience.",Negative
This beautiful resort has fallen into disrepair and is in desperate need of a renovatio,Negative
Good hotel with poor service,Negative
"Kandalama is an amazing hotel that has fallen into despair. The Hotel itself is amazing, the views, location etc. The staff are the friendliest staff we've met so far, extremely polite and courteous. Food is amazing, just love the taste and varieties. However, that's all that's there to like.
The rooms are okay, but are in desperate need of repair and maintenance. The door doesn't even offer the basic function expected of a door, and you can see in and out from the cracks around the door. This also meant that we could hear everything happening outside down to the noise of a person sweeping the compound. Rooms aren't soundproof either, you can literally hear the sounds of other people flushing their toilets. Not a pleasant sound!! TV, minibar etc are extremely out of date; the minibar is noisy!! Also, the bathroom fittings are yellowed, especially the tub and commode. We therefore didn't even use the tub. Not at all what you'd expect from a 5 star hotel.
Finally, although we were treated extremely well when checking in, the check out process makes you feel as if they're just throwing you out, as opposed to the warm check out process of similar class hotels such as The Hilton, The Grand Kandyan etc. Really need to improve on this, since this is the step that makes a customer consider coming again.",Negative
"I really wanted to love this hotel. We had spent a bit more money as a treat stay on our holiday but sadly it was disappointing as soon as we walked through the door, mainly because it’s not our cup of tea.",Negative

"- the thing that annoyed us more than anything was the prices when you get there. You’re in the middle of no where so have no option but to buy from the hotel. Despite having stayed in much nicer places in Sri Lanka, the prices they asked here were phenomenal. Shockingly expensive. They were quoting 2-3 times the prices for excursions than if you go out of the hotel and the food and drinks when you’re there are the same. Don’t get me started on the spa, it was more expensive than luxury spas in the UK! For me this makes a mockery of the tourists that visit and that’s something I really don’t agree with.",Negative
I wouldn’t go again and wouldn’t recommend this hotel to a friend.,Negative
"I came to heritance as our official annual trip. Me and my two colleagues had to share a double bed room even though they have claimed it will be a triple bed room. They just have dumped an additional bed in to the room which made the room conjested. The mattress of the additional bed was horrible, it was super tight and i got a back ache from it. Maybe its time that the hotel should invest on some good 'new' mattress.The bathroom was ok. Food was just ok. The pool was really good with low chlorine. Atmosphere around the hotel is good. Lot of scenery. Overall I feel the hotel is not upto the standards and does not maintain the 5 star quality at all. Not worth spending money for.",Negative
Overhyped. Didn't like the service or food. You can't build on just a geographic feature advantage,Negative
"Overpriced, too big, and unfriendly staff",Negative
"Beautiful hotel and a great buffet. The rest was not so good, unkind personnel in perticular the manager at the front desk. The a la carte restaurant had about the worst food we've had in Sri Lanka, definitely not worthy of 5 star hotel. When booking we requested a quiet room however when we tried to sit on the balcony we had to talk quite loud to hear on another due to power generator making constant loud noises. On a final note only 2 of the three hotels look like they are being cleaned. I would definitely not come here again.",Negative
Now this hotel has become a ordinary hotel. Buffet is also a normal one now. Not a grand one,Negative
"We booked a honeymoon package and it was not up to standard of a 5 star hotel. Rooms are bit old and not nicely decorated. We are entitled to get a chocolate platter and we received a small 'Mars' chocolate bar which they say as a chocolate platter(face palm) and we have to even remind them to get it. Further We were entitled for a sundown cocktail at the evening instead we got a mock tail and it was also once we requested .
This is not a good place to recommend for honeymoon.
Food was ok. Staff was ok. Pool could have been more clean",Negative
Yes. Room condition is not that good . Need refurbishment . Bed linen has to be changed .,Negative
The room is tired and dated with more bugs and insects than you would expect even knowing we are in the middle of the jungle.,Negative
"The food quality in all the restaurants was awful - 3/10. We did the buffet on the first night, the food was tasteless, over cooked and of poor quality, especially considering the Western prices. When we complained to the chef after the buffet he admitted he was ashamed of their offering. He comped our meal and we signed for the drinks. When we checked out the meal was on the final bill - I asked to see our signature and they showed us an unsigned check.
The second night we ate in the cafe, $15 for four shrimp all either raw or over cooked. The shrimp were wrapped in pastry so you couldn't tell what part of them you were eating including the head. Incidentally the appetiser came out five minutes after my main course, my partners meal came out 10 minutes after that. My club sandwich had clearly been made much earlier and then refrigerated - not acceptable for $18. My partners burger - the meat was indecipherable. When we complained about the timings (in addition my wine came out 10 minutes after my partner's cocktail on four occasions), the staff just laughed at us and gave us some excuse about different kitchens and bars preparing the food and drinks.",Negative
"You're trapped at this hotel for food choices and they exploit this to the full charging way too much for poor equality food.
There is not enough furniture in the cafe or by the pool and we struggled to find a place at both. The cafe gets very busy in the evening because people realise the buffet is more of a rip off and poor quality than the bar - $15 for spring rolls?!?
The music in the evenings took me back to the 80's to a cheap package holiday on the Costa del Sol in Spain it was loud and intrusive.
The cashier was trying to do three things at once when he checked me out speaking to his colleagues both on the phone and sitting next to him, he even stated checking out another customer before I was done.
On check out we complained to the duty manager. He seemed very unconcerned and just gave us a feedback form to complete. He said the problem would be fixed immediately - how ridiculous.
This hotel needs some western influence in its management team if it wants to successfully cater to western tourists, because the quality and value for money are simply not acceptable.",Negative

NOT RECOMMENDED.,Negative
"One of the most famous hotels in Sri Lanka as published in every travel magazine. So there are many Japanese! I feel like I've come to a tourist hotel in Japan. When asked if I actually recommend it, I can't repeat it. This is because hotel services, dinners, and hospitality do not match the number of stars. The hotel concept is understandable, but it actually smells like animals and has been standing for over 25 years. There are much better hotels in the area. If you want to be Instagrammable, go ahead.",Negative
Expensive and overpriced,Negative
We have been on the honeymoon package and it was the 2nd stay on our entourage. Starting with very late check-in provided although the booking was made 3 months before the arrival and with multiple reminders before. Not very comfortable staying in rooms and the only good thing was barely working Jacuzzi. The view was great though. The bed was so cheap and the cheap metal bars on the head board like a place kept waking when it was touched during the night because of ice coldness. In-room honeymoon package services were not provided at arrival and only after numerous times of in-call requests and meeting with the booking handler all arrived.,Negative
"Deceiving the foods, it's not worth the spend at all. Huge buffets with many selections but the taste was way lower than the expectations. However the same restaurant I have had meals some other days where it served well to the taste however this stay was not worth appreciating. Same variations of foods throughout the entire stay for two nights. Overall not satisfied with the stay and not recommended for a special stay, unless it's a quick one with a great natural experience",Negative
" In the evening (before dinner), we ordered a few drinks and snacks, but it took more than 40 minutes to serve us the snacks that we ordered. I was amazed at the fact that they take this much time to serve their customers, and I had to cancel it to go to dinner. However, the staff at the buffet/restaurant are outstanding! They are very quick and friendly. The food is very tasty, and the variety of food is also very good. Rooms are clean and tidy. The surrounding area is also very clean and pleasant. I wish they would fix their issues in terms of service in those areas; otherwise, it will give a bad impression that will last forever! ... Due to poor customer service, I felt the value for money was not met.",Negative
"the customer service did not feel like a 5-star hotel, they kept rushing us to eat as they said they were closing and I wouldn't have expected this from a 5-star hotel and this is my first time experiencing this poor service.",Negative
We had a very disappointing stay. The room we stayed didn't have good air conditioning. Didn't want to make a fuzz because we stayed only one night. However the staff and other facilities were good. Hopefully this hotel will fully gain its glory once tourism kicks off and the place gets maintained regularly. An amazing place to visit though at least only for the location.,Negative
"check in was delayed, kept the kids waiting for hours- they were focused on money only! Service at restaurant could have been better.",Negative
"The quality of the rooms is very low, the cleanliness is poor, cobwebs, paint stains on the windows",Negative
"A shadow of its former self.
Local 5 star hotels now outshine what was once a jewel of a hotel.",Negative
"for a 5* hotel and the price we were disappointed. The restaurant had zero atmosphere with average food and high prices. The majority of staff were not particularly friendly, which is the opposite of what we have found everywhere else in Sri Lanka! Due to its location (a drive down a very long and bumpy dirt track) taxis are required to get everywhere which is fine but the hotel charges extortionate amounts if you book through them. Once we had a couple of local contacts we saved so much money. We also felt some areas of the hotel were tired and needed some attention (for example we couldn’t get the plug out to drain the jacuzzi bath- that we’d paid extra for - and someone had to come with a plunger each time). Maybe they are just catching up post-covid but the vibe is strange!",Negative
"Unfortunately the experience that I had in December 2019 while on Honeymoon was no where close to 5 star experience. The staff and management was great. The architecture of the hotel is unique and amazing. We were upgraded to a Suite. However, the room was dusty and unclean. The windows had cob webs and was not clean. So couldn't enjoy the view from the suite. Also the smell wasn't that pleasant in the room. The food was not at its best either except for the Sri Lankan dishes. It was not the same Kandalama hotel that I have experienced many times before my last visit. I was really disappointed because it has been one of my favorite hotels since childhood. Hope this feedback would be taken as a positive in terms of bringing back the same Kandalama Hotel experience I used to know",Negative
"Staff looked very overworked. To the point where you don't want to ask for Thier help. Food is good. But the variety is not that much in the buffet. We got a very lower floor room eventhough we Arrived early (around 3pm), which was very disappointing. Not worth the money even at 1/3 of a discounted price. Can find much better experience at a lower price.",Negative
" You cannot ask a question for the second time, response would be with a different tone. Very unprofessional staffs, i am not referring to everyone but whom we met. Management needs to take it seriously..",Negative
"I love this hotel. Been coming here since I was kid. But however this time the food was very disappointing. Yes we understand they must have redcuded the spread but thats ok. The dinner on 31 / 08 was very bad. The soup was watery , the mutton curry was extremely salty. Many other dishes were lacking taste . The breaksfast on 31st morning had a fish curry that was gone bad and I informed that person behind the counter and he completely removed it.we are were not expecting this standard from kandalama. If not for food everything else was perefct",Negative
"However, we paid $800NZD ($500USD) for one night and that is far too expensive for what it was. It was nice, but not that nice. I understand, it’s not cheap running a place like this but even so, very expensive. The photos online on booking.com of the rooms looks a lot better than what it looks like in real life, so it’s quite deceiving. We were disappointed when we opened the door to our room. It was not as great as we were expecting judging from what we had seen on the website. The room was small and the decor is old fashioned and very 90s/retro. It needs a revamp to be more modern, especially if you are charging so much, make it worth it.",Negative
"Don’t pay 200usd for the cave dinner! The food was so disappointing, and not even worth half the money. - ( we complained and got 1/4 back. ) I would recommend the buffet instead. Besides that, the place is cool and the view is amazing. Staff is superb! - one thing they are missing is some better furniture there’s no soft couches og lounge areas where you can chill relax.",Negative
Even though the location is nice the staff is not very friendly and not well trained. And the maintenance seems bad.,Negative
"Dry seasons dont go there
Off seasons no visitors so facilities are not that good
Prices are high for dining on off seasons",Negative
Quite an old hotel and definitely needs some renovations..,Negative
"I stayed here on 14-16/08/2019. The view and the scenary was good. Room was clean and neat. However the buffet was not 5 star. Almost the same menu on all 3 days with less variety. Service was not speedy and not up to standards. There were unclean plates. On 15th breakfast there were no soup bowls placed and had to wait for 5-6 minutes inline until someone else brought in new bowls. No one cared about refilling food until the guests informed them.
Recommended for location, scenary, comfortable room but not for food and service.",Negative
Hotel is 5star...but breakfast is not 5star...horrible..no more foods for buffet..breakfast is looks like 3star..,Negative

" their quality of food is not really as good as other places we visited. Since the hotel is so isolated, you have no choice but to eat there. I also really felt that the final access road to the hotel was terrible.",Negative
"lovely hotel to visit,rooms are smaller than we expected and the view from the room was ok but we expected the lake view so before you're going there make sure the view from the room is there as u expected.the rock pool is not clean that day.,beware of monkeys because they coming to the balcony area so before you go to the balcony careful with them",Negative
Really nice place but service was not up to expectations. ,Negative
"I had a five star experience in previous times i went . But when i visited on November 2018, did not get the 5 star service i expected. The rooms were old and havnt been updated for years. Toilets were old. And even the staff were not that friendly. Only reason im giving atleast 3 stars is becz the food was amazing.",Negative
Nice place but very noisy if your bedroom is next to the bar....,Negative
Feel the place has lost its former glory. Average on every aspect.,Negative
"Rooms was very old and wall is damage , Reception service checking time are very well, No anyone help for checkout",Negative
"Not all staffs are friendly. Also Felt like I'm being nickeled and dimed; Won't take out small unknown phone charges, inconsistency in car service price listing. Not so attentive servers at the main restaurant. At the same price point, I am currently staying at the Taj Smudra in Colombo getting impeccable service.",Negative
