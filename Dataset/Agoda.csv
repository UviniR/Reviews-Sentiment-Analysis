Review,Sentiment
"Reception unimpressive, hotel very faded and worn, extremely expensive for everything, food priced at 5 star big city eg new york levels especially the snack restaurant. Also you are in the middle or nowhere so you have no options but to eat the lukewarm food at crazy prices. Transportation manager tries to up sell you continuously on a bigger car. V pushy. Obviously on commission, he is more expensive than if you ask at reception when he is not there. We booked the hotel because of its ratings. However the good ratings are very old, newer ratings are v bad but average is still high which is inaccurate. It hasnt been refurbished in over 10 years. We booked for three days and would have left immediately on arrival. However be warned the cancellation policy is to charge you for the full stay, which is not made very clear when you book. It's all very buried in the small print. Be warned. I would avoid this overpriced unwelcoming 3 star at all costs. If you have to see the location, go for lunch or dinner.",Negative
this is the worst 5 star hotel I lived.The waiters are kind to western in the restraunt.but the waiter asked my room number again and again.It made me feel unrespect.We lived in 5 star hotel need good service.But it even worse than homestay here.Before I came，I heard they give the worst room to Chinese people .It is true.Maybe Chinese people shouldn't choose this hotel.,Negative
"""Uncooked food, mouse”

The swimming pool is nice but not clean at times. There are mice. Staff addressed issues but didn't really give reasure us that this will not happen again. COLD, uncooked food! ",Negative
In need of an update,Negative
just one sentence: overrated and overpriced,Negative
"The hotel location and view are very good. We had booked 2 rooms with a 40% discount but this does not mean that the hotel should give us very old, not clean rooms. The bathroom's curtains were disgusting, the rooms not clean. Very disappointing.",Negative
"The view from the hotel is amazing. However, the service was bad and the hotel itself is old. The staff were either not educated or just no motivation to provide good service to the customers. Examples are that they got us the seats in the dining area but didn't provide us with menu, or that they didn't have any greeting or even a smile when seeing customers passing by them. We were very disappointed during our stay.",Negative
The service at kandalama was disappointing. Staff seemed lazy standing around looking at the pool talking not offering menus or assistance. Meals came out at different times. Mixed up massages we booked. Terrible take away breakfast. No offer to collect bags from room,Negative
"Scenery, use of rocks in the design, managers response to complaints",Negative
"this hotel is a nice novelty place to stay when in the area. we booked a standard room and were upgraded on arrival to a suite on a higher floor which was excellent! love the jacuzzi overlooking the forest and the room itself was massive, with dvd player, rain shower, and separate living space. however, the majority of the staff were quite useless and, at times, even rude. we asked if there was anyone else leaving the hotel at the same time as us, in order to share a taxi to the airport. we were told no immediately, without anyone at reception actually looking it up. it seemed we were a great bother to them. the breakfast buffet was quite good, but other meals were quite lacking, espeicially dinner in the ""fine dining"" restaurant. overall, i would recommend this for a novelty, and only if you can get upgraded to a suite.",Negative
Disappointing,Negative
Large hotel but service was dreadful. There was no record of my prepaid booking on check in and it took forever to sort a room out. Good news is that they upgraded us to a suite for the inconvenience.,Negative
"Over-priced, its a stunning place (the location), the hotel does have monkeys running everywhere so expect stuff to be taken, the staff is friendly. Facilities are usually not available to not clean (expect mice!). It was a disappointment came in expecting to be relaxing but the whole time we had to address issues. Food was cold, took over 2 hours for food to come, and most we're uncooked.",Negative
Food are not good as too high hotel prices.,Negative
"Architecture, which was cutting edge in it's day. Although looking tired now.

The hotel is situated in a fantastic spot overlooking the jungle. It is an extremely large hotel and we found it very impersonal. The rooms were very expensive, small and tired. The food was adequate but based on the prices charged should have been much better. The food was mainly buffet style. ",Negative
"""Scary Hotel”
Alote of monkeys surrounding the area try to get inside my room",Negative
Room aircon not working. Nice setting but maintainance lacking.,Negative
"Has to be refurbished and given a thorough moderni”
Peace breakfast scenery

Not too bad .Nothing exceptional ",Negative
"Very basic room furnishing”
Location

Location and views are good. Rest is at most 4 star if even that. Lots of hidden charges too. Not coming back.",Negative
"we stayed during the christmas holiday season. while i understand that hotel prices generally go up significantly during this time of the year, our stay was not worth the money paid. the service was good, but not of a five-star hotel. the hotel is built on a rocky slope, which brings nature close. but one of the drawbacks is that natural lighting is quite limited even during the day if you stay on lower floors and on the mountain side. ",Negative
"Heritance Kandalama is located in an outstanding view but that does not eliminate all its bad functionalities. For starters we booked with breakfast but Agoda messed up and we had to pay extra. The room is very noisy and you can hear everything from the corridor. The soup they served us looked like an hospital soup. The staff was not very attentive. Price - quality is not worth it. Only for the view, that made us enjoy the stay. ",Negative
Frankly speaking this is one of the best designer hotels. Ground staff is great but not the management. During my stay my room had been messed up by Monkeys.AUD 700 worth of my properties had been damaged.But no one from management took the accountability.My door was closed during the incident.Hotel staff was saying it was caused by Monkeys.But now I am bit doubt. ,Negative
"Nice views , but hotel itself needs complete refurbishment. Rooms very tired and missing extras that is normally expected of a 5 star hotel. Public areas sterile and sparse with nowhere comfortable sofas etc to sit on and dining room feels like a school cafeteria. Infinity Pool very nice but very squashed and very few sun beds as there is not enough room to cater for the large groups of tourists in this large hotel. However food was very good with vast breakfast buffet. ",Negative
Extremely disappointing stay. ,Negative
Stay was good but there was a major problem during check in. We were made to wait for half an hour before room was given. Kids were tired. We had travelled from Colombo to Dambulla &it was 10 in the evening. After waiting for 30 mins we were given the wrong room. My friends who were traveling wth us were given the room with the extra bed which were supposed to be ours. It is a v.big hotel. It is a v.long walk from room 414 to rm no 540. After we went to rm 540 we were made to walk to rm 414 wth the kids. Extremely inefficient staff kept on saying since computer was down the mistake happened. Further more they kept on talking on the phn instead of taking care of the situation immediately which is not expected of the staff of a hotel of that stature. I called for the manager several times but my requests to meet the Manager were unattended to. Lapita Banerji.,Negative
"ervice in the common bar areas was consistently slow and disinterested, this spoiled the overall experience. We would have liked more chairs around the otherwise excellent pools",Negative
"The hotel is beautifully located. When it comes to standard, it seems overrated. The service is quite poor and the interior definitely needs polishing up a bit.",Negative
"Having said that the rooms are on the smaller side, food very average and personally I think that a bit expensive for what it has to offer.",Negative
"In my opinion this is not a 5 star hotel. Thee rooms are very old, the sheets are not clean and the towels smell. From the minute we arrived we were approached to sign up for all the different activities the hotel offers which are extremely overpriced. The hotel architecture and location in the middle of the rock and jungle is very imressive but quality wise not up to 5 star standards.",Negative
Kandalama is a bit run down now. It looks like it needs a good lick of paint. Also had problems with check in taking a LONG time. Disappointed on the whole,Negative
"We arrived in the middle of the jungle, in the middle of the night. All good. Received our complementary 'drink' (juice), only to be told that our pre-paid booking was for a single. No problem, we were told, they would upgrade us. The upgrade was a liar, they had us in the same room, charged us an extra $US70 & just pushed two single beds together.",Negative
"great hotel, rooms are a little tired, but still comfortable and clean and tidy. the hotel hangs off and blends into the landscape, very much feels part of the forest. however the food + beverage and service are all sub-standard when considering the overnight rate. i know, that the tourism market in sri lanka is still developing and further competition will make these prices more reasonable, but at this stage, there is still room for a lot of improvement. ",Negative
"beautiful location
little choices or flexibility; expensive!; mattresses and pillows were horrible

The location is beautiful, if hard to get to. I would only recommend to people planning to go and only stay there and spend the serious money needed for a nice room",Negative
This was my 3rd stay and the hotel has started to have a tired look. Outdoor areas need more cleaning as it smells. Decor needs freshening up,Negative
"Issues on arrival, it needs to be clearer on the Agoda website that it is possible to book a room for this hotel that only has a 1 person occupancy. First time I have ever come across this issue before ever. And it was an issue as I then had to pay an extra US$40 per night for my husband to share the room with me. Because the hotel thought I was travelling alone they had then put me in literally the worse room in the hotel on the Sigiriya side - it was a twin room, very damp dark and fusty smelling and on the lowest floor level. I also believe that booking through Agoda meant that we received the worst room allocation as even after paying an extra $40 they were not able to provide a better room and the following night moved us down the corridor so at least had some sunlight and room was not musty but still lowest level in the hotel on that side. ",Negative
"We arrived with high expectations and were very disappointed The layout of the hotel requires you to walk about 10 minutes from the room to to the swimming pool and dinner area. A gap between the door and the floor was wide and from the bed we heard anyone who passed in the corridor When we ordered something to eat from the cafe, it was inedible but thay still forced us to pay for it The pool area, no one bothered to clean and the pool itself was very cold so we could not stay there more than a few minutes On the second day, and after countless complaints, we got a quieter room but it was too little too late and our vacation has been ruined!",Negative
"Nice hotel in a jungle setting. The rooms are relatively small and the cleanliness needs to be improved. Although the staff were friendly, they were not overly helpful. We booked the standard room and so was shown to a tiny room in the bottom floor of the hotel with no view and next to loud rennovations, despite the hotel being empty as it was low season. When we asked to be moved and mentioned we were on our honeymoon they said they were fully booked! but did move us to the same room 2 floors up. ",Negative
"this is a lovely relaxed hotel with an amazing view over the lake and able to see the animals nearby. but on saturdays they allow anybody to have lunch and then use the facilities. instead of 5-10 people in the pool there were about 40, with no space and killing the relaxed atmosphere. also in the evening one of the local banks takes out employees and families for dinner, so very loud music etc. any other time its great",Negative
"A very pleasant hotel quietly undergoing refurbishment. Suite was nice and could be called charming, but comfortable apart form terrible pillows, as lumpy as an old bed. Restaurant a little limited but fine for a few days stay and good quality. Would we stay again?, an absolute yes as this is out 2nd visit.",Negative
"the hotel is big and has many facilities

they charging me for children meals when i arrived they didnt tell me that.",Negative
or us who have travelled worldwide the hotel was not one we would chose again as it had no ambience and the restaurant and service very average. Good place to visit but not to stay.,Negative
Many complimented about the food so I was looking forward for an amazing buffet for the price that I paid Rs6000 and it was nothing amazing just average. All the charging points are at floor level so it’s a hassle sometime. ,Negative
"Based on hotel's location, the views all round are breathtaking. Though there are bugs, it is only to be expected. The room service was prompt when we had issues with the jacuzzi. Christmas eve dinner had a fantastic spread and a pleasant performance, and the effort put in is much appreciated. Downsides are that the staff at the restaurant were a tad grumpy and tend to take awhile to follow-up on requests (if at all). I was also mistakenly chased after by a staff to foot the bill for another table; they thought I was leaving when I was merely going to get my food. No apology was made. The facilities other than the infinity pool are a bit dated and neglected (e.g. library), but can be overlooked since not many use these facilities. ",Negative
Very disappointing .. The rooms especially the bathrooms are in desperate need of upgrading. The food was mediocre .. My dinner and that of my partners was not particularly nice in the fine dining restaurant. The other was a buffet which is not my favourite choice of food. Same with breakfast. It is obviously a choice of property for groups more as to its position than star rating. We complained about Our room as we realised we were under the restaurant and at meal time all we could hear were chairs being Moved about .. It was noisy and disconcerting for the money paid .. The reception staff on check kindly listened to Our complaint and gave us a gift as compensation .. I do not think I would recommend the property to anyone ,Negative
"the hair dryer was exploring when I was using it, and the hotel did nothing but give two cans of jam. The supervisor his name card to me saying if I had any question I could call him. The next day I called him for some reservation problem at their other hotel at bentota, he was rude and was not trying to help me at all. I can feel that they felt I wasn't going to ask for anything due to the accident so they treated me like nothing. I was very dissapointed about their service.",Negative
"Hotel in beautiful setting, selection of F£B outlets and good souvenir shop

A hotel in a beautiful setting. The room was comfortable and luxurious. However, staff can be more efficient as they did not set up the extra bedding till past 11pm and we had a very tired 10 yr old.",Negative
"This hotel is an interesting design - built into rock faces and tropical forest. It stretches 1km along the side of a hill, overlooking a fairly ordinary looking lake. Hotel is starting to show its age, particularly in the bathroom where we had multiple plumbing issues. The free WiFi does not have good coverage and we had a very weak signal in our room. The WiFi is also slow. Buffet included breakfast was good and the a la carte restaurant was excellent.",Negative
"hotel in a panoramic setting, close to nature. serve excellent buffet except the waiters seem in a hurry to 'chase' us away by eagerly clearing away our empty plates (well this is acceptable) but not the cutlery please! ended up we had to request for the replacement of cutlery several times over the whole buffet session, which was very annoying! ",Negative

Ended up we had to request for the replacement of cutlery several times over the whole buffet session, which was very annoying! (We are a group of 16 travelers).",Negative
the staff lacks attitude and the crowds of locals for the vesac festival where very unpleasant. the buffet looked always eaten up and items where not replaced. we refrained from trying the evening buffet after our morning experience.,Negative
"Big rooms and bathrooms. Great breakfast

Everything was a negotiation which is quite disappointing for a 5 star hotel. Food was good. Staff was a bit challenging",Negative
Great Location and design of the hotel but poor maintenance and service. Overall average experience....,Negative
"The views were excellent

Enjoyed but would not return to big and no atmosphere ",Negative
noisy at night.,Negative
Our stay left us with mixed feelings. This is a 20 year old resort that remains architecturally impressive although we never felt totally comfortable or welcome. It's probably the best place in the area and other guests seemed to love it. It's possible we just didn't get what the place was about in addition to occasional poor service.,Negative
"Nice views of the lake but a pain to get to due to the unpaved road. Also, while the architecture is unique in that it incorporates the natural environment, it's not as great as we were led to believe. Also, the rooms and restaurants were only slightly above average.",Negative
"We had booked one Panoramic room and one Superior room, but were assigned two Superiors on check-in. When brought to their attention, the front-desk clerk tried to persuade me that we were assigned the correct rooms until I showed then the illustration of the Panoramic room from their website. We were then upgraded to a Suite and Deluxe room the next day. Travellers: beware that you get what you paid for. Having said that, the staff were generally helpful and efficient. Some language difficulties were encountered but nothing that would be totally lost in translation if you keep to simple words. ",Negative
"really needs some restyling as well. In its present state it's neither stylish nor welcoming. The first room we were allocated had a musty smell. The second was fine. Bathrobes, which we had to ask for, looked as if they had been used since the hotel first opened. Overpriced.",Negative
the place is a bit isolated and prone to package tours who graze the elephantine buffet. ,Negative
they should give the option for a la carte dinner instead of just offering the buffet. the gym was ok and had the basic equipment for someone to use.,Negative
"Service can be better at the restaurant, agaoda price was misleading for the booking which caused us to delay the checkin",Negative
"The room was pretty worn and outdated- probably due to COVID times. Lots of little bugs in the room and a couple geckos, but you are in the middle of the jungle. We felt like the room didn’t look quite like the pictures. But the grounds were beautiful and great pools. Food in the restaurant was good and staff very nice. We were located on the far end of the property and it’s possible this side is more outdated than the rest, as we were told the main building was booked to capacity.",Negative
"My stay at this wonderful was fantastic! The only gripe I have about the hotel was the dated room furnishings that breaks the 5-star immersion. Crusted detergent stains around the toilet flush handle, window stains in the bathroom and other small things damage the hotel's reputation. Another complain was from one staff who slammed the car door on my girlfriend's head the first time we arrived without apologising. This was rectified by the other staff but it did leave a very sour first impression for my girlfriend. ",Negative
"Great hotel on the lake with 2 lovely pools. Hotel is dealing with monkeys that are constantly around, well part of being in the wilderness! Food is not great- and can be improved. Sigurya is just 15 minutes away. A little bit of paradise! ",Negative
"1. The location of the hotel was very difficult to find without renting a car 2. The circumstance of the hotel was good,spacious,and magnificent 3. Our toilet flush didn't work well,we called the receptionist several times, at last the staff came and resolved the problem for us 4. The most unsatisfactory thins was the sudden power off many many times,which cast shadow in my soul,so you would see a candle in the bathroom.But the hotel couldn't solved the problem,what a pity",Negative
"The buffet breakfast""more than made up for the slight disappointment of the evening's offerings. I expected to be more wowed by this place than I was but still enjoyed my stay. ",Negative
"Though the interior is outdated, e.g. our bathtub did not flush when needed. Staff is friendly, we asked the hotel to organize some tours. Both tours & restaurants are okay though overpriced. ",Negative
Expensive for Foriegners,Negative
"we were delighted with the way the hotel rose up out of the jungle from apparently nowhere. the front desk and check in were very efficient a with a choice of welcome drinks. the room was well appointed as was the bathroom. the service in the restaurants was very poor including being told we had not ordered any food after waiting 40 mins for it to be served! the buffet dinner and breakfast was average but irritating at breakfast in that you had to catch the eye of a waiter to get tea or coffee. it would have been much simpler to allow guests to help themselves. no one really likes lukewarm stewed tea or coffee which is what you get with current system. there seems an overall lack of management supervision throughout the hotel. there are 3 pools - the one on the top terrace did not look very clean but the one called ramshee pool at far end of dambulla wing gets the most sun and therefore the warmest, but it is hard to find! there is very little info in the rooms and only one plan of the hotel (with no labels) at the bottom of the stairs. if you do not want to be looking into the trees you need to be in a room above the 4th floor. we had a panoramic room, which was worth the extra money. however, if you want to sit on your balcony in the dambulla wing be prepared for the permanent drone of a large generator, we found it very noisy. i feel a hotel of this class should spend some time and money thinking about how to insulate it. the front desk was exceptional and very willingly ordered cars, organised trips to the nearby caves and providing picnic lunch. the other departments need to take a leaf out of their books! housekeeping never seemed to answer their phone and the front desk used to pick up the call. if you are wondering what to do with drivers etc there are very good drivers from the hotel. we went onto bentota from kandalama which took over 5 hours we were driven very safely by a hotel driver and had a picnic included for a reasonable price.",Negative
The hotel was great but we were unlucky and ended up facing the bottom of the rocky hill with nothing to see but the rock.,Negative
" Our room was disappointing as we booked a panoramic room, were upgraded and still could not see anything as there were trees in front of the balcony. ",Negative
I had some issue with my reservation so they upgrade my room and they act very fast. ,Negative
only down side is the dinning options are quite expensive. ,Negative
but the resterant either buffet dinner or finrvdining are bad. the buffet seems to have wide varities but cheap and not that good taste. the lamb in the fine dining resterant are oily with quite strong smell not tasty at all.,Negative
" The food was ok, but the dining room itself feels a little cold and impersonal compared to some of the other hotels we stayed at. Overall worth a visit but there are better wildlife/eco hotels to stay in Sri Lanka ",Negative
The staff is not the friendliest and there is always a negotiation which is quite frustrating at a 5 star hote,Negative
"A little tired and overpriced”

It was a grand hotel a while ago, and still has a lot of potential. But feels a little tired, not updated with the times, furniture a little beat up, and overpriced for the quality of the stay. Great service by the staff of course, even though some of the processes like the arrival were a little awkward, could use a little more training in finesse in service.",Negative
Disappointed with the upkeep and maintenance of the hotel. A lot more run down than expected.,Negative
"heir quality of food is not really as good as other places we visited. Since the hotel is so isolated, you have no choice but to eat there. I also really felt that the final access road to the hotel was terrible.",Negative
"The hotel Architecture was fantastic and the rooms were as expected. Food was poor. There were two options either buffet or normal restaurant. We tried both and both were poor. Sadly, when staying here there are no other options…",Negative
"We loved everything about this hotel except the service which, although better than many places in Sri Lanka, was still slow and disorganised. The NYE banquet was simply the most amazing spread of food I've ever seen - expensive for Sri Lanka at $150 pp but we felt like royalty eating it.",Negative
"It really is a magnificent building, and we loved walking around the area and looking out over the lake. The monkeys were great fun too! However, we had a major issue with the room that we were allocated for three people. This was described as a ""panoramic"" room suitable for 3 adults, but it was an ordinary sized room that they just offered to put another bed into (this hadn't been prepared in advance for us). This would have been a real crush for the three of us, and at I was really very unhappy. The staff were very helpful, though, and moved us to a larger room at no additional cost. Just need to be aware that this is an expensive hotel, and be aware of some of the cheaper rooms that are low down in the building with very little to view except the immediate jungle.",Negative
The only down sides were that there was so many mosquito's which filled the room if you opened the windows but what can you expect around a lake.,Negative
"3) didnot anticiapte that food (dinner) would be so expensive. at almost rupees 3000 per person, this was not expected in srilanka. that too this hotel is in the middle of nowhere literally. 4) didnot like the bugs that seem to be everywhere in the night - hoards of them on pretty much every single wallthat you could think of. one each landed in my son's and husband's coconut water which they offered as soon as we arrived.[perhaps it is not a good idea to serve any kind of food/drinks n the night in the open when such things are likely to happen there] 5) didnot like - the fact that i asked for a outside cab number to travel onwards but was told that they didnot have any numbers other than the hotel owned ones which we later found out cost almost double (which adds to a lot if you are travelling long distance). compare 14k to 7k like that.",Negative
But the compound is large and there's many restaurants so you won't get bored eating at the same place every time. ,Negative
"Unfortunately, it rained from the day we arrived to the day we left. Fortunately, we caught glimpses of what could be on sunny days, making us want to come back for more. Locked it immediately & enjoyed watching the monkeys at close distance. ",Negative
" Biggest disappointment during our stay was the a la carte restaurant. Both appetizers (carpaccio of fish) were partly frozen. Futhermore, my wife asked for her beef tenderloin to be medium cooked. But when it was served it was almost raw meat",Negative
A negitive is that the food needs improvement.There is a new chief who made himself known to us.The new chief is updating the menues. ,Negative
The bathroom was quite old and after bathing we had a pool on the floor. ,Negative
"I stayed at the heritance kandalama for one night, not enough! It is very far away from Sigiriya lion rock, it takes about 30 mins! Ive paid 2000 Rs to get to hotel, dont know if it is a reasonable price. And it takes 1 hour to get to polonnaruwa by vehicle with 80 USD.",Negative
The hotel is in need of interior updating but the grounds are outstanding. ,Negative
"At dusk, lots of monkeys are on the tree beside the pool while we're swimming. We waited for a while till our rooms are ready.",Negative
"Beautifully conceived hotel but we had a disappointing stay as we were charged extra even though we booked through Agoda. Staff were quite unhelpful, have a bit of an attitude. Food was fine and plentiful. Great outlook over the lake and we saw an elephant. The monkeys got into our room and took several items, so watch out for them.",Negative
"glad we only stayed one night - a bit to formal for us. wasn't chilled. also the food at the a la carte was very average. bfast was okay. definitely glad we went there for the experience, but didn't feel that we needed to stay any longer.",Negative
" there's something wrong with the cold water, the room 202 we stayed had something wrong with the water tap, there's no cold water but only hot water no matter how to adjust it. same goes to the shower, very inconvenient. but have to say it's beautiful hotel , you have to stay there once. ",Negative
Room was not ready upon arrival even though informed hotel the night before. Missing pages in room service menu. Informed staff who checked us in and was told that to call room service to see what they have!! Uninterested to help. Had to wait a good 20 minutes in the room for it to be all set up. Internet connection was also intermittent and not stable. Breakfast spread was good though and staff was attentive n obliging. ,Negative
Do not leave the doors open as there are lots of monkeys there!,Negative
" one low point though is the erratic wi-fi. the signal was very weak in our room, and we had to stay in central areas to get a decent connection. not that big a deal though, as it is nice to disconnect. ",Negative
"swimming pool very small, impossible to have a sun bed given there are only a few. no real bar. breakfast and buffet served in a very large, crowded room. not very good and not very romantic. i really recommend the a la carte menu restaurant on the 7th floor which is very good and not expensive.",Negative
